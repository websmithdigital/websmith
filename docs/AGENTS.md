# AWS-01 Always-Read Rule — WebSmith Repo

This file is registered as a **global opencode instruction** (via
`opencode.json` → `instructions`) so it is loaded on every task in this
repository. Keep it in permanent sync with
`docs/UNIVERSAL_LICENSE_PLATFORM_IMPLEMENTATION.md` — the master single-source-of-truth
implementation document.

## Rule 0 — ALWAYS READ THE FINAL MD FILES FIRST

Before creating, modifying, or deleting **any** code, config, template, route,
or documentation in this repository:

1. **Always read `docs/UNIVERSAL_LICENSE_PLATFORM_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** (the
   master implementation document) first for the domain you are touching.
2. Read this `docs/AGENTS.md` for the standing AWS-01 rules.
3. Do not write code from assumptions. If the request does not match the
   documented architecture, **update the documentation first**, then write code.
4. The markdown files are the source of truth — never let code and docs diverge.

## Rule ALWAYS-UPDATE — KEEP THE MD FILES CURRENT

- Every time a **rule, architecture, workflow, or AWS-01 behavior changes**,
  update **BOTH** this `docs/AGENTS.md` and
  `docs/UNIVERSAL_LICENSE_PLATFORM_IMPLEMENTATION.md` on the same task.
- Never finish a task that changed behavior without recording it in the final
  md files.
- `docs/UNIVERSAL_LICENSE_PLATFORM_IMPLEMENTATION.md` must always reflect the
  current state of the platform (progress entries included).

## AWS-01 Communications Center — Non-Negotiable Invariants

Keep these in sync with the master doc (see its AWS-01 / Phase 3 section):

- **UI/UX-only scope**: the Communications upgrades must never alter the sending
  (SMTP), receiving (IMAP), queue, schema, auth, or notification engines/APIs.
- **Public storefront is untouchable (one approved UI exception)**: `www.websmithdigital.com/software-store`
  (PostgreSQL `products` + `/api/v1/store/*` + `/api/v1/checkout/*`). The
  purchase/cart/wishlist/checkout/payment logic is never edited — the ONLY
  approved change is the **Software Store Email Center header entry** (see the
  "Software Store Email Center Entry" rule below): an Email icon beside the
  existing Wishlist and Cart icons in the `/software-store` header that opens
  the SHARED `UniversalEmailDialog` in `customerMode` — the FULL existing
  customer Email Center (all `actionConfig` actions EXCEPT the admin-only
  `history`: Send Email / Buy License / Renew License / Activate / Reactivation
  / Device Replacement / Support / General / Software Store Enquiry), no
  `defaultAction`/`allowedActions` restriction, store theme applied to the
  portaled modal via `themeStyle` → `Modal.containerStyle`. Customer-mode Send
  posts to the public `POST /api/portal/support-message` with the recipient
  resolved SERVER-SIDE (buy-license / renew / software-store →
  `sales@websmithdigital.com`; send / activate / reactivation /
  device-replacement / support / general → `support@websmithdigital.com`).
  Everything else on the storefront stays untouched.
- **Customer Email Center — 9 unique default messages + customer attachments
  (see master doc "Customer Email Center — 9 unique default messages + customer
  attachments" progress entry)**: the customer-mode Email Center (`/software-store`
  Email entry + buy/renew portals) pre-fills ONE unique customer→admin default
  message per action — Send Email → **General Email Request**; Buy License →
  **License Purchase Enquiry**; Activate → **License Activation Request**; Renew
  → **License Renewal Request**; Reactivation → **License Reactivation Request**;
  Device Replacement → **Device Replacement Request**; Support → **Technical
  Support Request**; General → **General Support Request**; Software Store →
  **Software Store Enquiry** — substituting ONLY existing dynamic values
  (`customerName`/`defaultCustomerName`, `productName`/`defaultProductName`,
  `licenseKey`/`defaultLicenseKey`; empty detail lines omitted); admin
  (non-customerMode) defaults unchanged. **Attachments work for ALL 9 options**
  via the EXISTING universal attachment system: the shared dialog's attachment
  section is enabled in customer mode (SDK attach stays admin-only), customer-mode
  Send posts multipart to the PUBLIC `POST /api/portal/support-message` when files
  are attached, and that public route now accepts `multipart/form-data`, validates
  (`validateAttachmentFiles` max 5 / 10MB / allow-list), stores (`storeUploadedFiles`),
  attaches to the Brevo send (`toBrevoAttachments`), and links to the customer
  `conversation_messages` row (`linkConversationAttachments`) + the
  `notification_logs` row (`linkEmailAttachments`) — the same pipeline as the
  admin composer. Recipient routing / identity fields / structured body / per-IP
  throttle / auth / SMTP / IMAP / queue / schema unchanged.
- **Built-in mailboxes** (`support@`, `sales@`, `no-reply@`) are app-config
  defaults; enabling/disabling is an app-config toggle + `mailboxes.is_enabled` —
  never delete accounts.
- **Never render mailbox passwords in plaintext**: mask stored credentials
  (`********`) and strip blank/masked passwords from PATCH payloads so edits do
  not wipe stored credentials.
- **Unread is derived**: count = conversations with customer replies newer than
  the last admin reply / `admin_read_at` (GREATEST subquery). Stats handler is
  `force-dynamic`.
- **Add Mailbox workflow** (see master doc Phase 5 "Add Mailbox Workflow Fix"):
  new mailboxes are verified (IMAP + SMTP) **before** they are saved via
  `POST /internal/backend/mailboxes/test-connection` (reuses the same
  `imap`/`nodemailer` connection logic as `[id]/test`; never changes the SMTP/IMAP
  implementations). Verification failure → the UI blocks the save and shows the
  specific reason; success saves through the unchanged `POST /internal/backend/
  mailboxes`. All mailbox events log to `audit_logs`
  (`mailbox_created`, `mailbox_create_failed`, `mailbox_connection_test`), readable
  via `GET /internal/backend/logs`. The error/success toast must always stay above
  open modals (`z-[100]`).
- **Phase 7 Redesign — Mailboxes nav + Auto Reply + one-sided connection tests**
  (see master doc Phase 7 entry): the sidebar's **Mailboxes** section (top) owns
  the mailbox rows (health dots) + folder list + Add Mailbox; Settings / Templates
  / Signatures / Auto Reply are nav items under Communication Settings
  (`SETTINGS_DEF` / `TEMPLATES_DEF` / `SIGNATURES_DEF` / `AUTO_REPLY_DEF`, each with
  its own `kind`; `refreshCurrent` resolves all four). `test-connection` supports
  **one-sided tests**: a side (IMAP/SMTP) runs only when all its required fields
  are present — Test Incoming / Test Outgoing send the other side blanked;
  `data.imap`/`data.smtp`/`overall` appear only for tested sides. **Auto-reply**
  lives on the mailbox row: the IMAP sync answers the FIRST message of a NEW
  conversation when `auto_reply_enabled` using `auto_reply_template_key` +
  `auto_reply_signature` (fallback `auto_reply_message`, then `signature`), sends
  via the same nodemailer pattern as `[id]/send`, records the admin reply in
  `conversation_messages`, `notification_logs` (`event_type: 'auto_reply'`) and
  `audit_logs` (`auto_reply_sent`), and sets the conversation to
  `waiting_customer`. The Auto Reply panel edits drafts locally and saves via
  `PATCH /mailboxes/[id]` (fields `auto_reply_template_key`/`auto_reply_signature`
  added to schema via `ALTER TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`). Signatures are stored in the
  `settings` collection document (`signatures` array, `GET/POST
  /internal/backend/communications/settings`) — no new table. Never bypass the
  save-time connection gate; never render stored passwords.
- **Mail Delete feature + Allow Email Deletion toggle** (see master doc Phase 8
  entry): permanent conversation deletion is a **real data deletion**, one
  atomic transaction per request — `permanentlyDeleteConversations()` in
  `lib/communications/delete-conversations.ts` (BEGIN → delete
  `conversation_messages` [FK-cascades `conversation_attachments`] +
  `message_queue` + `communication_conversations` + `conversation_deleted`
  audit row → COMMIT; any failure ROLLBACKs and leaves data unchanged). Only
  conversation-exclusive data is removed — `requests` (shared Universal
  Request Center), `notification_logs`/`audit_logs` (system ledger) and
  `email_attachments` are intentionally left intact. Attachment FILES are
  unlinked only AFTER commit and only when no remaining row in
  `conversation_attachments` OR `email_attachments` references the same
  `storage_path` (shared files are never deleted). **Backend-enforced
  toggle**: `allow_email_deletion` lives in the `settings` document
  (default `true`; merge `!== false`) and the DELETE handlers
  (`conversations/[id]?permanent=true`, `conversations?ids=`, `?action=empty_trash`)
  return 403 `EMAIL_DELETION_DISABLED` when off — never rely on UI hiding.
  UI: "Delete Forever" buttons (reader toolbar + bulk selection, hidden when
  disabled), confirmation `Modal` in the existing style, immediate
  list/detail refresh via `refreshCurrent()` + `fetchStats()`, toasts at
  `z-[100]`. Soft-delete/Trash flow is unchanged.
- **Mailbox active-account cleanup — disabled mailbox hides its email data (see
  master doc "Communications — Mailbox Active-Account Cleanup" progress entry)**:
  `mailboxes.is_enabled` is the source of truth for VISIBILITY. Disabling a
  mailbox hides its email data from EVERY mailbox view (Inbox / Sent / Draft /
  Waiting / Failed / Queued / Spam / Trash + `mailbox_id`- and category-scoped
  lists) WITHOUT deleting any row; re-enabling restores visibility per the
  existing rules. The filter is `(cc.mailbox_id IS NULL OR EXISTS (SELECT 1
  FROM mailboxes mb WHERE mb.id = cc.mailbox_id AND mb.is_enabled = TRUE))`
  applied to the conversation WHERE in the list + stats routes (including the
  separately-built trash + unread count WHERE lists and the queue `failed`/
  `queued` counts, which LEFT JOIN `communication_conversations` + `mailboxes`
  and show rows only when `cc.mailbox_id IS NULL OR mb.is_enabled = TRUE`),
  plus the detail GET (a disabled mailbox's conversation returns 404). System
  mail (`mailbox_id IS NULL` — Websmith Communications support/sales/no-reply)
  is NEVER affected; other active mailboxes are never affected; no email
  record is deleted; no schema change; no new mailbox system; send/receive/
  queue-processing architecture unchanged; Delete/Restore/Permanent Delete
  behavior unchanged. The UIs (`communications/page.tsx` + `manage-mails/`)
  need NO change — both already read these backend routes. Files:
  `app/internal/backend/communications/conversations/route.ts`,
  `conversations/stats/route.ts`, `conversations/[id]/route.ts`,
  `communications/queue/route.ts`.
- **Manage Mails — centralized mail workspace** (see master doc SECTION 0.18 /
  Progress Tracking entry): the standalone page `app/internal/api/communications/
  manage-mails/page.tsx` (full-viewport Communications layout, NO app sidebar)
  manages the built-in **Websmith Mail** accounts (no-reply / support / sales) +
  user **Mailboxes** + their mail in ONE 3-pane UI, reusing ONLY the existing
  backend read-only — `/internal/backend/communications/settings` GET/POST
  (system-account `is_active` toggle + display_name/reply_to/signature edits
  persisted immediately via a full settings-doc POST), `/internal/backend/
  mailboxes` (enable/disable, sync, set-default, `[id]/test`, send-test,
  DELETE), `/internal/backend/communications/conversations` (list/detail, PATCH
  `mark_read`/`mark_unread`/`archive`/`restore`, soft-DELETE, permanent bulk
  DELETE + account-scoped Empty Trash both gated by `allow_email_deletion`).
  **Account-scoped routing**: a mailbox shows mail by `cc.mailbox_id`; a system
  account whose email matches a configured mailbox routes through that mailbox,
  otherwise by `routing.support_categories` / `sales_categories` /
  `['general']` for type system. **Sidebar rule**: the **Manage Mails** leaf
  lives under Communications → Email (`/internal/api/communications/manage-mails`)
  and active-route resolution is **deepest-prefix** — exact path match wins,
  otherwise the longest matching prefix is active (`deepestMatch()` in
  `components/internal-api/Sidebar.tsx`), so the child page never highlights the
  parent Communications overview. Reply/New Email reuses `UniversalEmailDialog`.
  Styling is a scoped `.manage-mails-ui` block in `app/globals.css`
  (`.mail-action-button` Navarog21 ridge/glow in `#149CEA`→`#1479EA`,
  `.mail-boundary` panels, reduced-motion guards) — never a global `button`
  selector. The Add/Edit Mailbox form keeps the blank + auto-detected rules and
  the save-time connection gate; masked/stripped passwords on PATCH.
- **Communications Center — consolidated sidebar + single Communications Setting
  (Phase 12, UI-ONLY — see master doc "Phase 12 — Communications Setting
  consolidation" progress entry)**: the sidebar of
  `app/internal/api/communications/page.tsx` now shows ONLY **Websmith
  Communications → Communication Center → Mail** (Inbox / Sent / Draft /
  Waiting / Failed / Queued / Spam / Trash, `ext-*` + custom folder rows,
  badges from `Stats`) and **Categories / Labels** (All / Sales / Support /
  Activation / Renewal / Reactivation / Hardware / Trial / Payment / SDK /
  Customer / Sent / Notifications / Universal Email), plus a pinned bottom with
  exactly **Communications Setting** + **Manage Folder** (opens the existing
  folder-manager modal). All former nav destinations — Websmith Mail accounts,
  Mailboxes, Templates, Signatures, Auto Reply, Manage Mails — were REMOVED
  from the sidebar (no duplicates; the `manage-mails` route file is untouched
  but no longer reachable from this page). **Communications Setting**
  (`activeFolder 'settings'`) is ONE consolidated workspace
  (`renderSettingsWorkspace()`: the middle pane is hidden, the center pane
  renders a section tab bar **General / Websmith Mail / Mailboxes / Templates /
  Signatures / Auto Reply**): **General** = the system communication settings
  (General / Email Deletion / Routing cards + the single Save — the system
  Communication toggle lives here and is NEVER duplicated), **Websmith Mail** =
  the built-in accounts rendered with UI display labels
  (`SYSTEM_ACCOUNT_UI_LABELS` / `systemAccountUiLabel`: Websmith Authentications
  — no-reply@, Websmith Support Team — support@, Websmith Sales Team — sales@;
  presentation-only overrides, backend settings values untouched) with the
  enable/disable toggle + Edit / Test / Sync actions + IMAP / SMTP / Sync /
  Health status grid, **Mailboxes** = the existing full mailbox-management UI
  (grid + detail: enable/disable toggle, Add / Edit / Delete, Test / Sync /
  Set Default / Send Test Email, connection status badges Connected /
  Connection Failed / Authentication Required / Disabled + `last_error`
  display — UI placement only, NO connection-logic change), and **Templates /
  Signatures / Auto Reply** = the old Manage Mails configuration UI (one
  source, no duplicate controls). Settings navigation state lives in
  `settingsSection` (local, not a sidebar route); entering settings reloads
  commSettings + mailboxes + templates. No SMTP/IMAP/queue/schema/auth/
  storefront logic changed.
- **Communications Center live fixes (Phase 13 — see master doc "Phase 13 —
  Communications Center live fixes" progress entry)**: (1) **stats route
  trash-count 500 fixed** — `GET /internal/backend/communications/conversations/
  stats` crashed on every request (`syntax error at or near "WHERE"`, 42601)
  because the trash count appended `WHERE cc.deleted_at IS NOT NULL` after the
  shared `${whereSQL}` (which already carries its own `WHERE`); the trash count
  now builds its OWN WHERE list (`deleted_at IS NOT NULL` + optional
  `mailbox_id`), so the UI gets live inbox/sent/waiting/failed/queued/unread/
  trash numbers instead of `{inbox:0,…}`. (2) **IMAP sync never stored email
  messages — fixed** — `POST /mailboxes/[id]/sync` INSERTed the nonexistent
  `has_attachments` column into `conversation_messages`, so every customer-message
  INSERT failed inside the per-message try/catch AFTER the conversation INSERT
  committed (conversations existed with zero messages → bodies never rendered,
  unread always 0); the INSERT now uses real schema columns (`conversation_id,
  sender_type, sender_name, sender_email, message, is_internal, created_at`).
  (3) **Admin reply goes to the CUSTOMER** — the Brevo fallback recipient is
  `conv.customer_email` (was the admin/company address), `{{request_id}}` is
  filled, and the mailbox-SMTP path reports `emailDelivered: false` + a warning
  when SMTP throws (never fake success). (4) **Delete/restore always re-fetch** —
  after any delete/restore attempt (including partial failures) the UI clears
  the selection, refreshes the list + stats, and toasts "X of Y moved to Trash"
  on partial success. (5) **One full-width mailbox card per mailbox** in
  Communications Setting → Mailboxes (`renderMailboxGrid()` full-width,
  Websmith Mail card style; avatar/label/badges/email, Enable/Disable toggle,
  purpose, IMAP/SMTP/Sync/Health grid, `last_error`, Test / Sync / Set Default /
  Edit / Delete, Send Test Email, expandable Sync Logs when selected — all
  inside the single card, no grid|detail split). **Every mailbox action is
  dynamic against the real mailbox DB id** — `mailboxAction(mb.id, endpoint)`
  → `POST/PATCH/DELETE /internal/backend/mailboxes/[id]/…` (backend resolves
  the row by id); no mailbox-specific email/address is hardcoded anywhere in
  the action logic, so a newly added Gmail/Outlook/custom mailbox gets the
  same cards + working actions with zero new code. (6) Middle panes widened
  380→400px; the reader thread shows `sender_email`. Only 4 files changed:
  `page.tsx`, `admin/communication/reply/route.ts`, `communications/
  conversations/stats/route.ts`, `mailboxes/[id]/sync/route.ts`; no auth/
  notification/OTP/storefront changes.
- **Communications Center is a unified mail client (Mail / Websmith Mail /
  Mailboxes / Internal / Manage Mails)** (see master doc SECTION 0.18 +
  "Communications mail-client redesign" progress entry; **sidebar structure
  since Phase 12 = Mail + Categories/Labels + Communications Setting only —
  see the Phase 12 bullet above**): the main page
  `app/internal/api/communications/page.tsx` sidebar is now `Mail` (email
  folders Inbox / Sent / Draft / Waiting / Failed / Queued / Spam / Trash, all
  `ext-*` + custom folder rows, badges from `Stats`), `Websmith Mail` (the
  built-in system accounts support/sales/no-reply — row = health dot +
  display name + email, active when the account scope matches), `Mailboxes`
  (external mailbox rows with health dots; clicking opens **account-scoped
  mail** in the Mail Inbox, NOT the old mailbox detail pane), `Internal`
  (All + category folders + Email Logs / Universal Email) and a `Manage Mails`
  group (Communication Settings / Templates / Signatures / Auto Reply /
  Manage Folders + a **Manage Mails** button that navigates to
  `manage-mails`). Account rows click through `handleAccountSelect()` →
  `setAccountScope({kind:'system'|'mailbox', id})` + `setActiveFolder('ext-inbox')`;
  **folders inside Mail keep the account scope, system-wide views clear it**
  (`handleFolderChange`: `!key.startsWith('ext-')` → `setAccountScope(null)`);
  `loadConversations()` applies the scope server-side (mailbox → `mailbox_id`
  param on the existing `/communications/conversations` route — the ONLY
  backend addition; system account → `mailbox_id` when its email matches a
  configured mailbox, else `category=` its `support_categories`/
  `sales_categories`/`['general']` list). The sidebar is **full-height
  scrollable** (its own `overflow-y-auto`, header stays fixed) so many
  accounts/folders never clip. Sender identity is account ID based and always
  derived from real configured accounts — `buildSenderAccounts(commSettings,
  mailboxes)` (+ `defaultSenderId`, `accountForConversation`, module-level in
  the page; exported `SenderOption` from `UniversalEmailDialog.tsx`). The
  reader shows the **receiving account** (`accountForConversation`: mailbox
  wins by `conv.mailbox_id`, else the system account owning the category) in
  the To: lines instead of hardcoded addresses. **From dropdowns**: the
  `UniversalEmailDialog` (optional `fromAccounts`/`defaultFromId` props,
  "From" select above To; used by New Email with the default sender, by
  Forward with the receiving account, and by Reply/Reply All — see the Phase
  14 entry: the reader's inline EMAIL composer was removed and replies open
  the same dialog). Composer/dialog sends carry
  `from_account_id`/`from_email`/`from_name` (+ `from_mailbox_id` for
  mailboxes) into the existing `admin/communication/send` and
  `admin/communication/reply` routes — which now honor them as a **sender
  override**: `from_mailbox_id` sends via that mailbox's SMTP (same nodemailer
  pattern as `[id]/send`), otherwise `from_email`/`from_name` override the
  Brevo sender identity. No SMTP/IMAP/queue/schema/auth logic changed; no
  hardcoded sender addresses added.
- **Mailbox integration removal is integration-level** (see master doc Phase 9
  entry): `DELETE /internal/backend/mailboxes/[id]` no longer deletes only the
  row — it calls `removeMailboxIntegration()` in `lib/communications/remove-mailbox.ts`
  (one BEGIN→COMMIT: delete conversations WHERE `mailbox_id` = integration id
  via the shared `deleteConversationRowsTx()` rows cascade [messages →
  attachments, queue, conversation], delete `mailbox_sync_logs`, delete the
  `mailboxes` row, audit   `mailbox_removed`; ROLLBACK on failure; attachment
  FILES unlinked after commit only when unreferenced). Ownership comes from
  the new nullable `communication_conversations.mailbox_id` column
  (FK→mailboxes ON DELETE SET NULL, ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS migration AFTER
  the mailboxes DDL), stamped by the IMAP sync INSERT + COALESCE UPDATE — the
  ONLY schema change; SMTP/IMAP/sync/reply logic is untouched. **Protected**:
  `SYSTEM_MAILBOX_EMAILS` (support@/sales@/no-reply@websmithdigital.com) → 403
  `SYSTEM_MAILBOX_PROTECTED`, never removable. **Legacy unowned mail**
  (pre-column conversations, mailbox_id IS NULL) is swept ONLY via the
  explicit opt-in `?cleanup_legacy_email=true` (or
  `removeLegacyMailboxConversations()`), matching by address but NEVER touching
  conversations owned by a remaining mailbox. **Real-world data profile of the
  IMAP sync**: it always creates `category='general'` conversations (no
  license key, no messages) — this profile identified the 234 old
  `keeogamer@gmail.com` inbox leftovers (real-DB cleanup 2026-08-09: 238 → 4
  preserved real conversations; 15/15 verification checks passed). No
  cron/background sync exists (manual `[id]/sync` + client-triggered queue),
  so a removed integration cannot resurrect. Real-DB verification lives in
  `tests/communications/remove-mailbox-legacy.verify.mjs` (real schema only,
  no mock tables; read-only report by default, `--apply` cleans + re-verifies
  + rollback-proof + protected-mailbox snapshot comparison).
- **Communications Center real-behavior fixes (Phase 14 — see master doc
  "Phase 14 — Communications Center real-behavior fixes" progress entry)**:
  (1) **Idempotent soft delete** — `conversations/[id]` DELETE returns
  `success:true` + `data.already:true` ("Conversation is already in trash.")
  instead of 400 when `deleted_at` is already set, and every
  delete/restore/archive/mark-read/mark-unread button in both mail UIs is
  disabled while a request is in flight — kills the double-click
  "already deleted" error toast. (2) **Bulk PATCH endpoint** —
  `PATCH /internal/backend/communications/conversations {action, ids:[…]}`
  (mark_read/mark_unread/archive/restore, one transaction, per-row
  `{total,updated,failed,not_found}`; archive skips trashed, restore touches
  only trashed); both mail pages use it for selection actions with real-count
  toasts (`"N conversations marked as read"`, amber `warn` toast on partial
  failure) and clear the selection up-front. (3) **Stats scoping** —
  `conversations/stats` accepts `category=` and applies it to statusCounts +
  trash + unread counts (the unread count previously ignored ALL params).
  (4) **One universal composer for Reply/Reply All/Forward** — the reader's
  inline EMAIL composer is removed; Reply/Forward + the Templates panel open
  `UniversalEmailDialog` with `conversationId`/`defaultSubject` (`Re:`/`Fwd:`)
  /thread-context/`defaultFromId`; the dialog gained optional
  `defaultSubject/defaultMessage/defaultCc/defaultBcc/conversationId/templates/
  signatures` props, **CC/BCC fields**, **Template ▼ / Signature ▼** insertion
  (enabled-only) and **reply mode** (Send → `admin/communication/reply` with
  subject + cc/bcc + `from_*` override). The inline composer under the reader
  is now **Internal Notes only** (`is_internal:true`, never an email).
  (5) **Subject/CC/BCC through the pipeline** — `admin/communication/reply`
  and `admin/communication/send` parse cc/bcc (comma/semicolon, regex
  validated, 400 on invalid) and pass them to the mailbox-SMTP nodemailer and
  Brevo paths; reply accepts a `subject` override. (6) **Honest delivery** —
  reply returns `emailDelivered:false` + `warning` when Brevo throws (message
  stays saved); send's `queued:true` (mailbox SMTP failure) and reply's
  `emailDelivered:false` render as amber warnings in the dialog, never green
  success. (7) **Detail page** (`conversations/[id]`) toasts real errors on
  delete/permanent-delete/restore/reply instead of swallowing them. (8)
  **Manage Mails** toolbar uses the bulk PATCH with real-count/warn toasts;
  `softDelete` handles whole selections with per-row results. Verified:
  `npx tsc --noEmit` 0 errors, `npm run build` green; NOT deployed (awaits
  user approval).
- **Email System Final Fix (see master doc Phase 15 entry)**: admin replies
  ACTUALLY reach the customer on every account type. ROOT CAUSE: the universal
  composer posted `is_internal: "false"` (STRING) and the reply route gated the
  whole email-send block on `!is_internal` — the truthy string meant the email
  was NEVER sent (only stored + status + audit). Fixed in the reply route: the
  value is normalized via `parseInternal(v)` (`true`/`"true"` → internal,
  everything else → real email), so the composer's `"false"` string is treated
  as a real reply; an
  Internal Note returns early `{success:true, internal:true}` (never an email).
  Reply recipient = `conversation.customer_email` on BOTH paths (mailbox SMTP
  nodemailer + Brevo), From/Reply-To derived from the real receiving account
  (mailbox wins by `conv.mailbox_id`, else the system account owning the
  category). Honest delivery: the route UPDATEs `email_sent`/`email_error` on
  the exact message row (`RETURNING id`) after each attempt (both paths + IMAP
  sync auto-reply); readers show green "sent via email" / red "email failed"
  (title = error). Outgoing attachments: the shared composer shows the
  attachment section in reply mode (SDK zip attach stays admin-only) and posts
  multipart to the reply route, which stores files under the shared
  `ATTACHMENT_STORAGE_PATH`/`public/attachments/email` pattern, attaches them to
  the real outbound MIME for BOTH paths, and links `conversation_attachments` to
  the message. Incoming attachments: `POST /mailboxes/[id]/sync` saves
  `parsed.attachments` to storage + `conversation_attachments` linked to the
  customer message. `interactiveSenderId()` (both mail pages) skips
  `no_reply`/`no-reply` accounts as the default interactive sender — automated
  mail keeps its dedicated no-reply route. "New Email" buttons relabeled
  **Compose** (Reply/Reply All/Forward/Internal Note labels unchanged). Reply
  All CCs the receiving account's address. `GET
  /communications/conversations/[id]` computes `has_attachments` via EXISTS so
  the standalone conversation page's attachment indicator works. OTP + Software
  Store entry (`POST /api/portal/support-message`) untouched; one shared
  composer. Files: `app/internal/backend/admin/communication/reply/route.ts`,
  `components/internal-api/UniversalEmailDialog.tsx`, `app/internal/backend/
  mailboxes/[id]/sync/route.ts`, `app/internal/backend/communications/
  conversations/[id]/route.ts`, `app/internal/api/communications/page.tsx`,
  `app/internal/api/communications/manage-mails/page.tsx`.
- **Final Email Fixes — Recipient Name + Universal Attachments + Strict
  Separation (see master doc "Final Email Fixes" progress entry)**: (1)
  **Reply/Reply All auto-fill Recipient Name** — `UniversalEmailDialog` gained
  `defaultRecipientName` (reset on open, editable); Communications Center +
  Manage Mails reply pass the real name (`d.customer?.name` → `conversation.
  customer_name`), email-like strings dropped via `/[ @<>]/`; Compose/Forward
  stay empty (no known recipient — never invented). (2) **One universal
  attachment pattern** — `admin/communication/send` now INSERTs the admin
  message `RETURNING id` and links uploaded files in `conversation_attachments`
  on BOTH paths (mailbox SMTP + Brevo), so Compose/Forward attachments show in
  the reader exactly like Reply/incoming (same storage + max 5 files/10MB/
  allow-list). (3-5) **Strict system/mailbox separation** — the DB signal is
  `communication_conversations.mailbox_id` (NULL = system mail, set = mailbox
  mail); conversations GET + stats routes accept `source=system|mailbox`
  (`mailbox_id IS NULL`/`IS NOT NULL`, 400 `INVALID_SOURCE` otherwise) and the
  Communications Center always sends it: internal folders (Websmith
  Communications) show system mail only, external Mail folders show mailbox
  mail only — NEVER mixed. Stats fetch per source (`systemStats`/
  `mailboxStats`) and badges/status cards are section-scoped; account pills are
  section-aware; a system scope always routes by its category list (never by a
  matching mailbox); `handleFolderChange` clears any scope that does not belong
  to the opened folder's section. No SMTP/IMAP/queue/schema/auth/notification/
  storefront logic changed. Files: `UniversalEmailDialog.tsx`, both mail pages,
  `admin/communication/send/route.ts`, `communications/conversations/route.ts`
  + `stats/route.ts`. Deployed 2026-08-13 (build green 289 pages).
- **Universal Email Attachment System (see master doc "Universal Email
  Attachment System" progress entry)**: the failing attachment pipeline was
  replaced with ONE reusable service for the whole Internal API email system.
  ROOT CAUSES: (1) send/reply validated by browser MIME against a narrow
  allow-list missing PPT/PPTX/RAR → valid files rejected; (2) uploads written
  only to `public/attachments/email` on the runtime FS → on Vercel serverless
  the FS is read-only/ephemeral so uploads could fail and download/preview URLs
  404 (runtime `public/` files are never CDN-served); (3) duplicated
  validation/storage across send/reply/sync. FIX: **`lib/communications/
  attachment-policy.ts`** (pure, client-safe: `EXTENSION_MIME` map for PDF/TXT/
  DOC/DOCX/XLS/XLSX/CSV/PPT/PPTX/JPG/JPEG/PNG/GIF/WebP/ZIP/RAR/7z/JSON/XML/HTML/
  MD/RTF/ODF/SVG/TIFF/BMP/iCal/vCard, `MAX_ATTACHMENT_COUNT` 5, `MAX_ATTACHMENT_
  SIZE` 10MB, `mimeForFile`, `sanitizeFileName`, `validateAttachmentFiles` with
  clear errors, `ATTACHMENT_ACCEPT`) + **`lib/communications/attachments.ts`**
  (server-only: `storeUploadedFiles`/`storeIncomingAttachment`, `toBrevo
  Attachments`/`toNodemailerAttachments`, `linkConversationAttachments`/
  `linkEmailAttachments` persisting bytes, `resolveAttachmentById`). Schema:
  `conversation_attachments` + `email_attachments` gained `content BYTEA`
  (`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` in `lib/backend-db/index.ts`) so
  bytes survive on serverless; disk `storage_path` stays best-effort +
  fallback. New download route `GET /internal/backend/communications/
  attachments/[id]` (proxy-auth, `force-dynamic`) serves DB bytes with
  `Content-Type` + `Content-Disposition` (UTF-8 `filename*`). send/reply/sync
  validate + link via the service (incoming mail never extension-validated).
  UI: dialog file input has `accept={ATTACHMENT_ACCEPT}` + client-side
  validation (same policy); reader threads download/preview via
  `${API_BASE}/attachments/<id>` (legacy public path only as fallback).
  Zero-attachment emails unchanged; unsupported types → clear 400 listing
  supported extensions. No public website / store / public API / SMTP / IMAP /
  queue / auth / notification logic changed. Deployed 2026-08-13, build green
  289 pages.
- **Communications Center — Real Sent location + native auto-sync fix (see
  master doc "Communications Center — R01 FINAL: Real Sent location + native
  auto-sync fix" progress entry)**: **(1) Real "Sent"** — `sent=true` is now a
  REAL filter on `GET /internal/backend/communications/conversations`: a
  conversation qualifies when it contains an outbound admin email that was
  actually delivered (`EXISTS conversation_messages cm WHERE
  cm.sender_type='admin' AND cm.email_sent=true`). It replaced the old FAKE
  Sent (`status IN ('resolved','closed')`) in the `ext-sent` FOLDER def
  (`app/internal/api/communications/page.tsx`), in Manage Mails' `sent` folder,
  and in the `conversation_folders` seed (`lib/backend-db/index.ts` →
  `{"sent":"true"}`). The stats `sent` count uses the SAME EXISTS definition so
  the Sent badge always agrees with the Sent list. Admin sends already stamp
  `email_sent=true` on both send paths (`admin/communication/send` + `reply`),
  so Sent reflects genuine outbound mail; delete/restore/permanent/empty-trash
  are id-based and work unchanged in Sent. **(2) Native-account auto-sync bug
  fixed** — the Communications Center live auto-sync polled `${API_BASE}` (the
  `/internal/backend/communications` INDEX route — NO `settings` payload) and
  read `settingsJson?.data?.settings?.communications?.mail_accounts` (always
  undefined), so the native support@/sales@ accounts were NEVER auto-synced
  from the UI. It now fetches the REAL settings endpoint
  `GET /internal/backend/communications/settings` and reads
  `settingsJson.settings.mail_accounts`, so native support/sales accounts sync
  on the same timer as configured mailboxes (the sync route's
  `nativeReceiveAccount` matches by the same account id). No
  SMTP/IMAP/queue/schema/auth/notification/storefront changes. Files:
  `app/internal/api/communications/page.tsx`,
  `app/internal/api/communications/manage-mails/page.tsx`,
  `app/internal/backend/communications/conversations/route.ts` +
  `stats/route.ts`, `lib/backend-db/index.ts`. Verified: `tsc --noEmit` 0
  errors, `npm run build` green (QStash signing-key env vars are required for
  the local build of the deployed `native-receive` route — set in production),
  `npm test` 6/6 + 13/13. Not deployed.
- **Communications Center — permanent-delete persistence + Sent spans both
  sources + silent auto-sync (see master doc "Communications Center — R01: TODO
  fixes — Permanent-delete persistence + Sent spans both sources + silent
  auto-sync" progress entry)**: (1) **Permanent delete never resurrects** — the
  read-only IMAP syncs (`mailboxes/[id]/sync` + `native-receive`) cannot dedupe a
  still-UNSEEN provider message once a permanent delete removes its
  `conversation_messages` rows, so it was re-imported as a NEW conversation on
  the next 2s sweep. New table `conversation_delete_tombstones`
  (`provider_message_id`/`sender_email`/`subject`/`mailbox_id`/`deleted_at`, PK
  on the three identity columns; DDL in `lib/backend-db/index.ts`).
  `permanentlyDeleteConversations()` now captures customer-message identities
  BEFORE the delete (`collectConversationTombstones`) and inserts them in the
  SAME transaction (`insertConversationTombstones`, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`);
  both inbound transports skip tombstoned mail (message-id lookup, plus a
  no-Message-ID variant by sender+subject+mailbox scope). Integration removal
  intentionally writes no tombstones. (2) **Sent spans BOTH sources — SUPERSEDED 2026-08-18 by the STRICT R01
  "Sent source separation + account filter dropdown" entry below** — the
  `ext-sent` folder def carried `noSource: true` so `loadConversations` skipped
  the `source=system|mailbox` restriction (outbound system/sales/support/
  admin-composed mail has `mailbox_id IS NULL`); the Sent sidebar badge, chip
  and status card showed `systemStats.sent + mailboxStats.sent`. (3) **Silent
  auto-sync** — the 2s receive timer now guards with `autoSyncInFlight` and
  refreshes the list via `{ silent: true }` (no spinner flash every tick, no
  destructive errors); every post-mutation refresh calls `refreshCurrent(true)`.
  Files: `lib/backend-db/index.ts`,
  `lib/communications/delete-conversations.ts`,
  `app/internal/backend/mailboxes/[id]/sync/route.ts`,
  `app/internal/backend/communications/native-receive/route.ts`,
  `app/internal/api/communications/page.tsx`. No SMTP/send/queue/auth/
  notification/storefront changes. Verified: `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors, `npm run
  build` green (296 pages). Not deployed.
- **Communications Center — STRICT R01: Sent source separation + Mailbox /
  System-mail account filter dropdown (2026-08-18, see master doc
  "Communications Center — STRICT R01: Sent source separation + Mailbox /
  System-mail account filter dropdown" progress entry)**: **(1) Sent never
  mixes sources** — the old `noSource: true` flag made BOTH Sent folders load
  the SAME combined record set (system + sales + support + admin-composed
  mail). It is REMOVED: Categories/Labels → **Sent** now loads `source=system`
  (system sent mail only, `mailbox_id IS NULL`) and Mail → **Sent** now loads
  `source=mailbox` (configured mailbox sent mail only, `mailbox_id IS NOT
  NULL`) via the EXISTING backend (`GET /internal/backend/communications/
  conversations?sent=true` + the default per-section `source` param — no
  backend change). Counts are source-scoped too: the Categories/Labels Sent
  badge shows `systemStats.sent`, the Mail Sent badge/chip shows
  `mailboxStats.sent`, and the pinned Sent status card reads the section's own
  stats and opens the section's own Sent folder (`sent` inside Websmith
  Communications, `ext-sent` inside Mail). The `noSource` field/guard was
  deleted from `page.tsx`. **(2) Mailbox / System-mail account filter
  dropdown** — a compact card-style dropdown (matching the Inbox/Waiting/Sent
  chips) sits directly BEFORE the Search control in the Communication Center
  toolbar. It lists **All Mail** + every configured account from the REAL
  backend data (system mail accounts from `commSettings.mail_accounts` grouped
  under "System Mail Accounts", enabled external `mailboxes` under "Mailbox
  Accounts" — labels/emails are the real configured values, never hardcoded).
  Selecting an account sets the existing `accountScope`
  (`{kind:'system'|'mailbox', id}`), so the current folder list, the Search,
  the badges/counts (`fetchStats` scopes per source + account) and the detail
  all stay consistent with the selection; **All Mail** clears it back to the
  unfiltered behavior. The account pills below the toolbar keep working as
  before. No Send / Receive / Delete / Restore / Permanent Delete / IMAP /
  Sales / Support / No-Reply / chat / schema / mailbox logic changed; no
  backend or other file changed. Files: `app/internal/api/communications/
  page.tsx` only. Verified: `tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0, `next build` EXIT 0
  (pre-existing Turbopack NFT warning only). Not deployed; awaits user
  approval.
- **Universal / System Trash separation (see master doc "Universal / System
  Trash separation" progress entry)**: the Communication Center has a dedicated
  **Trash for Universal Email / System conversations** (`int-trash`) fully
  separate from the Mailbox Trash (`ext-trash`) — the two email systems never
  mix in any folder including Trash. UI (`app/internal/api/communications/
  page.tsx`): `int-trash` is added to `FOLDERS` (`section:'internal'`,
  `kind:'list'`, `params:{show_deleted:'true'}`, `badgeKey:'trash'`), to the
  sidebar Categories/Labels group, and to the folder chips ("Universal Trash"
  reading `systemStats.trash`; the Mailbox Trash chip keeps reading
  `mailboxStats.trash`); `isTrash` covers both keys so Restore / Delete-Forever /
  Mark Read / Mark Unread / Archive gating and reader trash handling work
  identically. Soft delete → Trash, Restore, bulk PATCH, read/unread, counts/
  badges, category filtering, search and refresh are unchanged (id-based or
  already source-filtered by the list + stats routes: `source=system` +
  `show_deleted=true` → `cc.mailbox_id IS NULL AND deleted_at IS NOT NULL`).
  **Empty Trash is source-scoped**: the DELETE `?action=empty_trash` handler
  (`app/internal/backend/communications/conversations/route.ts`) accepts
  `source=system|mailbox` (400 `INVALID_SOURCE` otherwise) + optional
  `mailbox_id` + optional `category` (validated against the shared
  `VALID_CATEGORIES`) and permanently deletes ONLY the scoped trash (previously
  it deleted ALL trash — one section could wipe the other). The UI passes
  `source=system` from `int-trash` (+ scoped system-account categories) and
  `source=mailbox` from `ext-trash` (+ `mailbox_id` when a mailbox is
  account-scoped). No SMTP/IMAP/queue/schema/auth/notification/storefront logic
  changed. Deployed 2026-08-13, build green 289 pages.
- **Universal Trash "Failed to load conversations" — root cause + fix (see
  master doc "Universal Trash 'Failed to load conversations' — root cause +
  fix" progress entry)**: clicking Universal/System Trash showed "Failed to
  load conversations." — NOT a backend/SQL issue (the `source=system` +
  `show_deleted=true` trash path is correct and mirrors Mailbox Trash). ROOT
  CAUSE (live production logs): when the Internal API session
  (`api_center_token`) is missing/expired but the website session (`ws_session`)
  is valid, the proxy returns a **307 redirect** to `/internal/api/auth/login`
  for every `/internal/backend/*` call; the Communications page `fetch()` calls
  followed it by default and received the **login page HTML**, so `res.json()`
  threw → the loader's catch showed "Failed to load conversations." FIX
  (`app/internal/api/communications/page.tsx`, UI-only): a shared
  **`internalFetch()`** helper fetches with `redirect: 'manual'`, detects the
  3xx whose `Location` is `/internal/api/auth/login`, sends the admin back
  through the two-step login with `?next=<current location>` preserved, then
  throws. All READ loaders use it (`loadConversations`, `fetchStats`,
  `loadQueue`, `loadLogs`, `loadHistory`, `loadMailboxes`, `loadTemplates`,
  `loadCommsSettings`, `loadFolders`); working action/mutation calls (send,
  reply, delete, restore, mark read/unread, archive, mailbox create/test/sync,
  settings save, folder CRUD) are untouched. With a valid session Universal
  Trash loads deleted system conversations only, empty Trash returns a valid
  empty result (not an error), and Delete/Restore/Delete-Forever/read-unread/
  Empty Trash work id-based as before. No mailbox/compose/attachment/category/
  conversation logic changed. Deployed 2026-08-13, build green 289 pages.
- **Mailbox form is blank + auto-detected (no defaults)**: `newMailboxForm()`
  starts with NO provider, NO server hosts, NO email — the Add Mailbox form is
  completely empty. Typing the **Incoming Email** auto-detects the provider
  (Gmail/Outlook/Yahoo/Zoho/Apple/Fastmail/Proton/custom via `PROVIDER_PRESETS`
  + `presetForEmail`), fills IMAP/SMTP hosts/ports/encryption, and mirrors the
  address into both usernames **while typing** — a username only follows the
  email when empty or still equal to the previous address, so char-by-char
  typing updates (no freeze at the first keystroke) but a manually-changed
  username that differs is kept. The **Incoming Password mirrors into Outgoing
  Password** — outgoing follows when it is empty or still equal to the previous
  incoming password (kept in sync), while a manually-overridden outgoing
  password that differs is preserved (per-field override; all values stay
  editable). Unknown domains switch
  to `custom` manual mode (never invented server values). Provider select has
  an "Auto-detect from email" option. The Gmail/other App-Password help card
  renders only after a provider is detected. **Never** any default mailbox
  email anywhere in app/lib code (audited: `keeogamer@gmail.com` exists only
  in the cleanup-test script + docs). **All mailbox-form inputs carry explicit
  `name` + `autoComplete` attributes (`off` for text/email, `new-password` for
  passwords) to prevent browser credential autofill (the admin's own saved Gmail
  was otherwise leaked into the blank Add form).** Signatures are a Mail → Signatures
  section (settings-document `signatures` array): create/edit/delete/set
  default/preview + assign-to-mailbox; used by the reply composer and auto-
  reply. **Signatures now carry an `enabled` flag (default true).** Disabled
  signatures are excluded from the mailbox-form selector, auto-reply dropdowns,
  and the reply composer; `assignSignatureToMailbox` refuses disabled signatures;
  deletion clears `auto_reply_signature` references on mailboxes. The auto-reply
  server (`[id]/sync`) resolves `auto_reply_signature` (ID) → content from the
  settings document, skips disabled/unknown IDs, and falls back to the static
  `mailbox.signature` content — fixing the latent bug where the raw ID was
  appended to replies. Mailbox enable/disable is enforced server-side: sync returns 403
  `MAILBOX_DISABLED` when off (send + queue-process already filtered by
  `is_enabled`).
- **Final Mail Bugs fixed (see master doc Phase 10 entry)**: (1) **Trash leaves Inbox** — the trash model is `communication_conversations.deleted_at` (soft delete = Trash, restored via the `restore` PATCH action); Inbox + every non-trash list already exclude `deleted_at IS NULL` at the SQL level (never hide with frontend filters), Trash queries `show_deleted=true` → `deleted_at IS NOT NULL`, and inbox/sent/waiting/unread stats already filter it. Two gaps: the conversations **stats route now returns a `trash` count** (`deleted_at IS NOT NULL`, surfaced as the Trash folder badge via `Stats.trash` + `badgeKey: 'trash'`), and **`POST /mailboxes/[id]/sync` never re-imports trashed mail** — when the IMAP server still holds the (still-UNSEEN) message after the admin trashed it, the sync reuses the matching trashed conversation (`deleted_at IS NOT NULL ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 1`) keeping `deleted_at` set instead of creating a duplicate that would reappear in Inbox; auto-reply is skipped for reused trashed mail (`&& !reuseTrashed`). (2) **Gmail Create Mailbox failure** — root cause was the `POST /internal/backend/mailboxes` INSERT: 26 columns but only 25 VALUES (missing trailing `updated_at` value) → PostgreSQL `INSERT has more target columns than expressions` → generic "Failed to create mailbox." after the successful IMAP/SMTP test; fixed by adding the missing `$22` (`updated_at` = `now`) **AND** mapping `queue_size` to the literal `0` — the table column is `queue_size INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`, and binding the `now` timestamp string (`$22`) into an INTEGER column raises `invalid input syntax for type integer` (masked earlier by the column-count error); the VALUES tail is now `...$21,0,$22,$22` (26/26). Create still verifies credentials via `test-connection` before saving, rejects duplicates (`DUPLICATE_EMAIL`), allows `signature` empty, and saves the exact tested form payload; no connection/Gmail logic was changed.
- **Architecture hierarchy**: Master Doc → Language Templates → SDK Publisher →
  Generated SDK. Never edit Generated SDKs directly; never embed business logic
  in runtime generators.

## AWS-01 ULC Event Messaging & Activation Rules (Final)

See master doc **SECTION 0B** (Event Messaging & Activation Rules). Always honour:

- **Rule 1** — the backend `/internal/backend/license/status` API is the single source of
  truth; never compute license/plan/days/validity locally except absent-optional fallbacks.
  All Activation / Renewal / Validate entry routes (internal AND `/api/v1/*`) must call the
  shared `resolveGlobalLicenseStatus()` service in `lib/license/serializer.ts` — routes MUST
  NOT query the database or make business decisions on their own. The universal response
  (status/reason/actions/message + proper HTTP code) is returned to the SDK, which only
  renders it. Activation requires `ACTIVE`/`TRIAL_ACTIVE`; renewal requires `ACTIVE`/`EXPIRED`.
- **Rule 2** — hardware binding is permanent; never unbind/re-bind/clear it locally; a
  hardware mismatch only invalidates the cached `license_status` key. Message: "Hardware
  replacement requires administrator approval."
- **Rule 3** — a **fresh** license activation clears the old cached license state
  (license/plan/customer/expiry/activation) then reloads from the backend; preserve only the
  hardware ID and the offline message queue.
- **Rules 4 & 9** — every user-visible message is also written to the shared `LiveLog` (and the
  external forwarder); UI and LiveLog stay in sync per flow (startup/trial/activation/renewal/
  refresh/hardware/communication/general).
- **Rule 5** — pass through real server messages verbatim; never substitute a generic local
  string for a server-provided message.
- **Rule 6** — show a live "working…" progress state for any operation expected to take >1s.
- **Rule 7** — successful trial/activation/renewal always shows the `SuccessDialog` summary.
- **Rule 8** — errors explain what / why / next; avoid bare "Error"/"Failed"/"Unknown".
- **Rule 10** — run the 14 end-to-end validation scenarios before delivery.

## SDK V2 Single-State Architecture (Python Template)

See master doc **SECTION 0C**. Never regress:

- **One controller**: `LicenseEngine` (`license_engine.py`) is the **only** module that
  talks to the API, owns cache state, runs workflows, and mutates license state.
- **client.py is transport-only** — no `CacheManager`, no decision logic. UI modules
  (`universal_license_center.py`, `welcome.py`, `trial.py`, `activation.py`, `renewal.py`,
  `reactivation.py`, `communication.py`, dialogs) must never access `client`/`cache`/`_client`
  directly — they use engine methods (`validate_license_key`, `send_otp`, `verify_otp`,
  `mark_onboarding_complete`, `persist_runtime_state`, `flush_cache`, …).
- **Event-driven UI**: the ULC re-renders only from `LicenseStatusChanged` /
  `workflow.progress` events; success paths never call `_refresh_ui()` manually. Use the
  canonical 16-stage list from `WorkflowProgress` — never invent new stage strings.
- **GlobalStateMachine**: `workflow_progress.py` owns the single global state machine
  (`IDLE/VALIDATING/OTP_SENT/OTP_VERIFIED/PROCESSING/REFRESHING/COMPLETED/FAILED`);
  transitions are driven only by `LicenseEngine` (workflow guard + validate/send_otp/
  verify_otp/refresh/`_apply_fresh_state`), every `set()` emits `workflow.state` on
  `EventBus` and logs `WORKFLOW_STATE`. Exported via package `__init__.py`.
- **Automatic OTP (LOCKED §10)**: validation success immediately triggers
  `engine.send_otp()` — no manual Send OTP step; countdown timer + Resend OTP on expiry.
- **Renewal is payment-first**: ULC renewal path is Validate → Auto OTP → Verify OTP →
  Payment Confirmation (`_confirm_payment_dialog`, dummy payment — no provider contacted) →
  `engine.renew()` (extends the EXISTING license; never creates a replacement) → engine
  refresh → LicenseStatusChanged → success dialog. Renewal must NOT show the legacy
  "Renewal request submitted, our team will contact you" communication step.
- **UED is the sole email path for license/reactivation flows**: backend routes under
  `licenses/renewal-request`, `licenses/reactivation/submit`,
  `reactivation-requests/[id]/reject`, `reactivation-requests/[id]/approve` must use
  `sendEmail()` from `@/lib/email/brevo` (never a raw Brevo fetch). Auth (password-reset)
  and ticket-resolution routes keep their own senders and are intentionally NOT part of
  the Communications Center UED scope (AWS-01 auth/notification invariant).
- **No dead duplicate template code**: `renew_license_dialog.py` was deleted; `renewal.py`
  is the single renewal module. Never re-add duplicate renewal/communication dialog logic.
- **New foundation modules** (`event_bus.py`, `workflow_progress.py`, `dialog_manager.py`)
  are registered in `runtimes/python.ts` `MANDATORY_FILES` — never delete them.
- Engine `_workflow(...)` guard: every workflow logs `WORKFLOW_START`/`COMPLETE`/`ERROR`
  exactly once per stage and serializes under one RLock.
- Keep SECTION 0C in sync here and in the master doc (Rule ALWAYS-UPDATE).

## SDK Enterprise Enhancement Suite (Python Template)

See master doc **SECTION 0D** (20 enterprise areas). Never regress:

- **One owner per concern**: `session.py` (SessionManager), `permissions.py`
  (PermissionEngine), `config_manager.py` (ConfigManager), `feature_flags.py`
  (FeatureFlags), `offline_mode.py` (OfflineMode), `idempotency.py` (IdempotencyManager),
  `timeout_rules.py` (TimeoutRules), `communication_queue.py` (CommunicationQueue),
  `notification_center.py` (NotificationCenter), `error_catalog.py` (ErrorCatalog),
  `security.py` (SecurityRules), `migration.py` (MigrationRunner), `health_check.py`
  (HealthCheck), `metrics.py` (MetricsCollector), `version_compat.py`
  (VersionCompatibility), `support_workflow.py`, `rollback.py` (RollbackCoordinator).
- **These are utility/derivation layers, NOT controllers** — only `LicenseEngine`
  talks to the API / owns cache / mutates state. UI reads via engine accessors
  (`engine.session()`, `engine.permissions()`, `engine.can_activate()`, …).
- **Config reads** go through `ConfigManager` only; nobody calls
  `json.load(api-config.json)` directly. **Timeouts** come from `TimeoutRules`.
- **Idempotency**: every mutating workflow carries an idempotency key; repeated clicks
  produce ONE operation. **Security**: never store OTP/secret/password/token in
  plaintext; cache/hardware/customer encrypted at rest.
- **Encryption-at-rest is wired**: `cache.py` `enable_security(fingerprint)` is called
  from the engine `__init__`/`initialize`; writes are `ENCRYPTED:`-prefixed and fail
  closed when Fernet is unavailable; legacy plaintext cache files still load and upgrade
  on the next save; `license.key` is encrypted too. `CommunicationQueue` owns the
  engine's `_process_message_queue` flush (deliver callback → `client.create_communication`).
- **Fingerprint is versioned** (`v{n}:<hash>`); version mismatch re-verifies against
  the backend, never local re-bind. **Migration** v1→v2 preserves cache/license/
  customer/queue.
- All new modules registered in `runtimes/python.ts` `MANDATORY_FILES` and exported
  from `__init__.py`. Keep SECTION 0D in sync here and in the master doc.

## SDK Universal Activation UI + Shared UI Kit (Python Template)

See master doc **SECTION 0E**. Never regress:

- **One shared Tkinter UI kit**: `ui_styles.py` owns all theme tokens and reusable
  widgets (`COL`/`FONT`, `_rrect`, `GradientHeader`, `StyledButton`, `RoundedEntry`,
  `Card`, `SectionLabel`, `Subtitle`, `StatusPill`, `ProgressBar`, `GlobalMessage`);
  registered in `runtimes/python.ts` `MANDATORY_FILES` + exported from `__init__.py`.
  All screen builders draw only from this kit.
- **Activation dialog** (`_show_key_flow_dialog` in `universal_license_center.py`,
  formerly `activation.py`) is a contained step machine (`key` → `otp` → `final`)
  using `_set_phase`, `GradientHeader` card, shared `format_timer` countdown,
  `StatusPill` + `ProgressBar` progress, and `GlobalMessage`.
- **ULC activation form visual (compact colorful modern):** the visible activation
  UI in `universal_license_center.py` is a custom compact layer over classic
  tkinter — small centered card/container (subtle 1px border + primary 3px top
  accent), `_UVInput` rectangular textbox with slightly rounded corners and an
  accent focus ring (NO oval/pill shapes), `_UVButton` flat colourful buttons
  (primary/success/ghost) with a simple colour-only hover, `_UVPhase` plain text
  status line (no oval/Stupid badge), `_UVBar` thin 8px progress. No gradients,
  glow, shadows or animation. `docs/UI.MD` is used for structure/visual reference
  only. Visual layer only: the activation/renewal workflow, auto-OTP, 5-minute
  OTP timer, GlobalMessage, success dialog + SDK restart and engine delegation
  stay unchanged. Their API mirrors `RoundedEntry`/`StyledButton`
  (`.get`/`.state`/`.entry`, `.set_state`/`.set_text`/`._command`, `.start`/
  `.stop`) so handlers never change. Never remove fields, merge/hide controls,
  rename callbacks, or change button behaviour.
- **`activation.py` is the full standalone Activation UI again (ROLLBACK)**: it was
  rolled back from a thin re-export to the standalone `ActivationDialog` window
  (Hardware / Customer / Trial / License cards, Refresh + Activate actions, OTP
  step, GlobalMessage-driven status, restart confirmation). It still delegates to
  `LicenseEngine` (`validate_license_key`, `send_otp`, `verify_otp`, `activate`,
  `refresh`) and resolves every message through `GlobalMessage` — no raw
  `client`/`cache` decision logic. `open_activation_dialog(center)` opens it.
  Keep it a UI-layer module (SECTION 0C engine-first, no duplicate backend logic).
- Internal APIs/vars must never clobber tk.Canvas internals (use `_pw`, never
  overwrite `_w`); keep the engine surface (`_active_*`) unchanged per SECTION 0C.
- Runtime-guarded via `python -m py_compile` + headless Tk construction smoke test;
  keep `test:generation` 6/6 and `test:multi-runtime` 13/13 green. Keep SECTION 0E
  in sync here and in the master doc.

## SDK Multi-Runtime Parity (All 13 Runtimes)

Both docs are in sync. Never regress:

- **Every generated client must expose `getProducts` + `getTrialStatus`** (per-runtime
  casing: camelCase for node/typescript/javascript/bun/php/java; `GetProducts`/
  `GetTrialStatus` for go/dotnet; `get_products`/`get_trial_status` for python,
  rust and the `websmith_*`-prefixed C client) — these are the method names the
  production `SDKValidator` (`app/internal/publisher/sdk-validator.ts:323-376`)
  requires in the `validate-sdk` stage (`app/internal/publisher/index.ts:754`), which
  fails generation if missing. Implement against the real endpoints: `POST
  /api/v1/store/products` `{action:"list"}` and `POST /api/v1/trial`
  `{action:"status", hardware_id}` (POST works for every runtime's request helper;
  the store route also supports GET).
- **Runtime generators import `PublisherContext` as `import type`** from `../index`
  (type-only, elided at runtime) so `tests/sdk-generation/multi-runtime.test.mjs`
  can import them under `--experimental-strip-types` without resolving the heavy
  `../index` graph. Never change it to a value import.
- **`tests/sdk-generation/multi-runtime.test.mjs` is the parity guard**: it generates
  all 13 runtimes through the real generators, writes a minimal `api-config.json` +
  `manifest.json` (`kit_version` required), and runs `SDKValidator.validate()` against
  each package. Run via `npm run test:multi-runtime`; it is part of `npm test`.
  When editing any runtime generator, re-run it — all 13 must stay `valid: true`.
- **Full fidelity over string-presence**: the validator checks `content.includes(method)`,
  but new methods must be real working calls, not placeholder strings.
- **ALL 13 runtime generators are orchestration-only (since 2026-08-14)**: python,
  typescript, node, php, java, dotnet, go, rust, cpp, c, javascript, bun, deno all load
  their SDK from `template/<runtime>/` files (the single implementation source of truth
  per language) and only replace placeholders / validate / return the file map — no
  business/startup/hardware/activation/OTP/UI logic in any generator. Templates use
  canonical `${...}` tokens (`kit_version`, `runtime`, `generated_at`, `product_id`,
  `product_name`, `package_name`, `api_url`, `api_version`, `support_email`, `year`,
  plus runtime-specific ones) which every generator's placeholder map must cover
  (unreplaced known tokens fail generation). Never move business logic into a
  generator or bake context values directly into a template; never re-add the deleted
  broken template files. Keep this rule in sync with the master doc progress table
  (OPERATIONAL QA row).
- **Final runtime verification (2026-08-14) fixed three genuine template defects**
  that byte-diff parity could not catch (see master doc "FINAL RUNTIME VERIFICATION"
  progress entry): **rust** — `Cargo.toml` used the nonexistent `machine_uid` crate
  (real crates.io crate is `machine-uid`, imported as `machine_uid` in code) and
  `src/lib.rs` `initialize()` had a borrow-checker error (`match &self.license_key`
  then `self.store_license_data()` needs `&mut self` — fixed with `self.license_key.clone()`);
  **typescript** — the template failed `tsc --strict` (`cache.ts` assigned `unknown` to
  `Record<string, any>[]` → cast; `universal_email_dialog.ts` `await response.json()`
  typed `unknown` → `as any`); **cpp** — `client.hpp` was missing the `WelcomeDialog`
  class declaration/constructor (orphaned method bodies + `private:` at namespace scope,
  a pre-existing error since the original inline generator — header never compiled;
  full class restored from original output). After the fixes: `npm test` 6/6 + 13/13
  green, `cargo check` green, `tsc` build green, and real-wire smoke tests (local HTTP
  server) pass for node / python / typescript-compiled-dist / javascript. When editing
  a runtime template, prefer re-running the real toolchain when available (`cargo
  check`, `tsc --noEmit`, `node --check`, `python -m py_compile`) over diff-oracles
  alone.

## Public Website Contact & Social Media Settings (Manage Page)

Keep in sync with the master doc **SECTION 0.15**:

- **Single record, no new tables/endpoints**: all contact + social data lives in
  the Neon PostgreSQL `portal_settings` table document `key: "contact_info"`, served by the
  existing `/api/settings/public/contact_info` endpoint (`GET` public; `PUT`/
  `PATCH` admin-only).
- **Fields**: `headquarters`, `email` (Contact/Support), `sales_email`, `no_reply_email`,
  `hr_email`, `phone` (existing) + `mobile_number`, `landline_number`, `whatsapp_url`,
  `facebook_url`, `instagram_url`, `linkedin_url`, `x_url`, `youtube_url` (added).
  Never create another table/collection or a new endpoint for these.
- **Validation lives in shared `lib/site-settings.ts`**: URL hosts are strictly
  validated (facebook.com, instagram.com, linkedin.com, x.com/twitter.com,
  youtube.com, wa.me); emails via `validateEmails` and phones via
  `validatePhones` (digits/`+`/`-`/`(`/`)`/spaces only); the API rejects invalid
  values with 400 (`EMAIL_INVALID`/`PHONE_INVALID`), and the admin UI
  validates before submit. Never bypass these checks; never save bad
  addresses/numbers.
- **WhatsApp special handling**: admins may enter `https://wa.me/<number>` or a
  plain number — plain numbers are always normalized to
  `https://wa.me/<digits>` before saving; visitors always open that URL.
- **Empty = hidden**: public footer/contact/landing render a platform icon only
  when its URL is non-empty (`target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`); never
  render placeholder/empty icons. Mobile/Landline items render only when set.
- **Landing `#contact` section renders everything**: the `#contact` section's
  Contact Information derives from the contact_info record via `contactEmails`
  (`email`+`sales_email`+`no_reply_email`+`hr_email` as mailto links),
  `contactPhones` (`phone`+`mobile_number`+`landline_number` as tel: links) and
  `contactSocials` (every configured URL in one Social Media item). Every
  configured value renders — never first-item-only — empties are excluded (no
  invented values); the default Contact Email `support@websmithdigital.com`
  applies only until a DB value loads.
- **No hardcoded contact info anywhere**: never hardcode email addresses,
  phone numbers, or socials in public components — Careers / Support /
  Documentation / Contact pages all fetch `/api/settings/public/contact_info`
  and render DB values with fallbacks (General Support → `email`, Sales →
  `sales_email`, Mobile → `mobile_number`); the landing page's default Contact
  Email is `support@websmithdigital.com` until the DB value loads.
- **Email service uses DB senders**: `lib/email/brevo.ts` `sendEmail` resolves
  the sender per email type from the contact_info record — support-typed
  (`admin_notification`/`support_reply`/`conversation_created`) → `email`,
  sales-typed (`new_sales_enquiry`/`sales_reply`) → `sales_email`, all other
  automated mail → `no_reply_email` (env vars as fallbacks); the automated
  disclaimer applies only to no-reply sends; `{{support_email}}` placeholders
  auto-fill. Never hardcode a sender email in a call site.
- **Admin Manage Page** (`/admin/manage-page`): Contact Information card order is
  Headquarters Address → Contact Email → Sales Email → No-Reply Email → HR Email →
  Mobile Number → Fixed/Landline Number → Primary Contact Number; Social Media
  Links card sits below it; the single Save Changes button persists all fields
  together. Fields sit in responsive two-column grids (labels above inputs,
  inline validation errors, empty social rows show "Add link" placeholders).
  Do not redesign the admin UI.
- **Backward compatibility**: `headquarters`/`phone` fall back to previous
  defaults only when the saved value is empty.

## Website Media System (Neon, migrated from MongoDB)

Keep in sync with the master doc Progress Tracking entry "R01 — MEDIA MIGRATION
FIX + CLEANUP". Never regress:

- **Neon is the single media source of truth**: website media lives ONLY in the
  PostgreSQL `media_assets` table (created in `lib/backend-db/index.ts` `getDb()`
  DDL block — never add a duplicate migration file/helper). The id is a **native
  SERIAL integer** in production (HTTP evidence: registry returns `url
  "/api/media/3"`); code NEVER forces a UUID into `id` — inserts omit the column
  and the upsert conflict path uses `id = DEFAULT`, so fresh ids come from the
  column's own default on BOTH serial and uuid-default columns (schema-agnostic).
  The DDL block also runs idempotent `ALTER TABLE media_assets ADD COLUMN IF NOT
  EXISTS data/created_at/updated_at` so an existing production table that predates
  the `data` column is repaired in place, and an idempotent repair that (1)
  de-duplicates `slot_key` rows, (2) adds a UNIQUE constraint/index on
  `slot_key` when none exists, and (3) relaxes NOT NULL on any column this
  implementation does not populate (live production evidence: "there is no
  unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification" on
  every upload POST — the original migrated table had NO unique constraint on
  `slot_key`, so every `ON CONFLICT (slot_key)` upsert AND the seed failed with
  500 — and the ADD CONSTRAINT attempt aborted with 23505 "Key (slot_key)=
  (global_collaboration_video) is duplicated.", so production ALSO holds
  duplicate slot_key rows that must be removed FIRST — and the seed/upload
  INSERTs additionally failed with `null value in column "asset_key" ... violates
  not-null constraint`, a leftover NOT NULL column from the original table that
  no repo code references). The dedupe keeps, per slot_key, the row that has
  bytes (`data IS NOT NULL`) else the lowest id (`DELETE ... WHERE id NOT IN
  (SELECT DISTINCT ON (slot_key) id ... ORDER BY slot_key, (data IS NOT NULL)
  DESC, id ASC)`); the NOT-NULL guard walks `pg_attribute` and drops NOT NULL on
  every no-default column outside the populated set (`slot_key`/`file_name`/
  `content_type`/`file_size`/`data`/`created_at`/`updated_at`) via
  `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN %I DROP NOT NULL`; the constraint guard then
  checks `pg_index` for a single-column unique index covering `slot_key` and only
  when none exists runs `ALTER TABLE media_assets ADD CONSTRAINT
  media_assets_slot_key_uniq UNIQUE (slot_key)` — all three verified idempotent
  (2nd run deletes 0 rows / alters 0 columns / leaves one unique index) and
  verified against a real Postgres that reproduced the production table state
  (duplicates + no UNIQUE + no `data` column + `asset_key NOT NULL`): seed
  backfill + upload upsert + fresh-id minting all pass. No MongoDB media
  reads/writes, no Mongo fallback anywhere.
- **One authoritative implementation**: `lib/media.ts` (client-safe 14-slot
  `MEDIA_SLOTS`/`MEDIA_SLOT_INDEX`/`fallbackForSlot`/`MediaAsset`),
  `hooks/useMediaAsset.ts` (module cache + `refreshMediaAssets()` +
  `MEDIA_UPDATED_EVENT` re-fetch), `lib/media/storage.ts` (server-only Neon
  persistence + `seedMigratedMedia`), `GET/POST /api/settings/public/media` +
  `GET /api/media/[assetKey]`, and the Manage Page "Website Media" card. Never
  build a second media API, storage, slot list, hook, or manage-page editor.
- **Uploads always mint a NEW asset id**: `upsertMediaAsset` uses `ON CONFLICT
  (slot_key) DO UPDATE SET id = DEFAULT, …` (the DB column's own default —
  `nextval` on serial, `gen_random_uuid()` on uuid-default columns) so the
  immutable-cache file route
  (`Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`) can never serve stale
  bytes — the URL changes by construction. Never reuse an id for a new upload.
  (A forced literal `gen_random_uuid()` against production's INTEGER id was the
  original upload 500 — never regress to forcing a UUID into `id`.)
- **The SPA updates immediately after upload**: the Manage Page calls
  `refreshMediaAssets()` on success, which invalidates the hook's module cache
  and dispatches `media-updated`; every `useMediaAsset` consumer re-fetches and
  re-renders without a page reload. Never reintroduce a never-invalidated
  module cache (the original production bug).
- **Auth reuses the existing architecture**: POST uploads go through
  `apiHandler(..., { auth: "required" })` + `user.role !== "admin"` → 401 (the
  existing admin JWT). GET remains public (Neon-only, `force-dynamic`).
  Never add a new auth path; never expose internal endpoints.
- **Seed is a non-destructive seed/repair**: `seedMigratedMedia` inserts the
  committed seed assets (`global_collaboration_video` from
  `public/videos/API-Center.mp4` + `global_collaboration_image`) with **DB-native
  ids only when the slot is absent**; on an existing production table it REPAIRS
  metadata-only rows (`data IS NULL`) by backfilling bytes from the committed
  file via `ON CONFLICT (slot_key) DO UPDATE … WHERE media_assets.data IS NULL`
  (preserving id/file_name/content_type/file_size/created_at/updated_at), and
  never overwrites rows that already have bytes. It is a data-preservation seed
  + repair, not a runtime fallback, and only runs when the asset file is readable
  at runtime. The seed call in the DDL block is wrapped in its own try/catch
  (logs `Media seed error:` and continues) so a seed failure can never abort
  getDb's whole schema init.
- **Production upload 500 — ACTUAL root cause (2026-08-20)**: after deploying the
  UUID fix, Manage Page uploads STILL returned the generic 500. Live Vercel logs
  (`& vercel logs <deployment-url> --expand --json`) showed
  `API error (internal): error: there is no unique or exclusion constraint
  matching the ON CONFLICT specification` — the production `media_assets` table
  was created by the ORIGINAL implementation WITHOUT a UNIQUE constraint on
  `slot_key`, so both the upload upsert AND `seedMigratedMedia` failed. Adding
  the constraint then hit a SECOND blocker: production ALSO holds duplicate
  `slot_key` rows (`ADD CONSTRAINT UNIQUE` aborted with 23505 "Key
  (slot_key)=(global_collaboration_video) is duplicated." — the registry map
  hides them, so the duplicates were only visible in the runtime error), and a
  THIRD blocker: production ALSO carries an `asset_key` column that is NOT NULL
  with no default and is referenced nowhere in the repo, so the seed/upload
  INSERTs failed with `null value in column "asset_key" ... violates not-null
  constraint`. FIX: the media DDL block now (1) de-duplicates `slot_key` rows
  (keep the row with bytes, else lowest id), (2) relaxes NOT NULL on any
  no-default column outside the populated set (drops NOT NULL on `asset_key`),
  and (3) adds the UNIQUE constraint idempotently (see the bullet above). The
  id fix was correct but insufficient; the missing constraint + duplicates +
  the phantom NOT NULL column are the real blockers. Verified against a real
  PostgreSQL 18 (throwaway instance + temporary trust `pg_hba.conf` line for
  127.0.0.1, reverted after) reproducing the production table state (duplicates
  + no UNIQUE + no `data` column + `asset_key NOT NULL`).
- **Global Collaboration video consumer fix (2026-08-20, UI-only `app/page.tsx`)**: the
  public landing `global_collaboration_video` consumer is wired to the Neon managed
  source (`useMediaAsset` → `/api/media/<current asset id>`) and MUST render with a
  DIRECT `src={...}` attribute on the `<video>` element — never a `<source>` child.
  A changed `<source>` src does NOT run the browser media load algorithm, so the slot
  fallback (`/videos/WDS_UAC.mp4`) keeps playing the stale bytes after the async
  registry fetch resolves (root cause of "different video shown"). A
  `useEffect([globalCollabVideo.url])` calling `video.load()` + `video.play()` ensures
  the element reloads the current managed URL whenever it resolves or changes (every
  upload mints a NEW asset id). The fallback is used ONLY while the managed asset is
  unavailable (initial render / registry failure); no hardcoded video path remains in
  the consumer. Never regress to a `<source>` child for managed media; never alter the
  Neon schema / `media_assets` / upload API / MongoDB / auth / 413 / Manage Page.
- Keep this rule in sync with the master doc Progress Tracking entry.

## Internal API Side Nav — License Management (Sidebar Restructure)

Keep `components/internal-api/Sidebar.tsx` aligned (presentation only):

- **License Management** section owns **Licenses** (License Center
  `/internal/api/licenses/generate`, Generate License
  `/internal/api/sales/purchase`), **Device & Lifecycle** (Hardware
  `/internal/api/hardware`, Activations `/internal/api/activation`, Renewals
  `/internal/api/licenses/renewals`, Reactivations
  `/internal/api/reactivation-requests`), **Trials** (Trial Dashboard, Trial Templates).
- **No standalone "Hardware Management" section** and **no "Generate License" under
  Sales & Payments** — both live only under License Management.
- **Renewals page** (`/internal/api/licenses/renewals`) mounts the existing UI-only
  `RenewalsTab` component from `app/internal/api/licenses/generate/tabs/` — no new
  business logic, no duplicated logic there. Reactivations points to the admin request
  list, never the customer-facing activation center.
- Do not add dedicated per-page routes/icons/names beyond this regroup; nav routes,
  icons, permissions and active-route semantics are fixed/unchanged.## Universal Buy & Renew Portal (Internal API Only)

Keep in sync with the master doc **SECTION 0.16**. Do not regress:

- **Customer-facing standalone pages** `/internal/api/buy` and `/internal/api/renew` live inside the Internal API but are rendered as standalone full-screen pages — NO admin sidebar, NO admin navigation, NO admin login gate. `app/internal/api/layout.tsx` treats them like auth pages via the `isPortalPage` flag. Changing them must not change the admin dashboard for any other route.
- **No public/private data exposure**: the pages talk ONLY to the public portal backend `/api/portal/*` (catalog, OTP, license info, order create/pay). They never expose the admin products API, customer APIs, license-management APIs, internal IDs, or DB info. The browser never receives internal/DB data.
- **Server-side validation on every step** — never trust the browser/localStorage/UI: Product+Plan (+License for renew) are re-resolved from the DB by `lib/store/checkout.ts createPendingOrder()` (server prices), OTP is enforced server-side (`lib/portal/otp.ts hasVerifiedPortalOtp`) BEFORE any pending order is created, and renewal eligibility comes from `resolveGlobalLicenseStatus()` (Rule 1).
- **One payment workflow**: the portal REUSES `createPendingOrder()` (order creation) and, for fresh purchases, the store's `fulfillOrder()` — every store/buy flow shares logic, no second payment implementation. Renewal uses `lib/store/renewal.ts` (extends the existing row; never creates a new license) which shares the same order → payment → invoice architecture.
- **Buy generates a NEW license** (`fulfillOrder`); **Renew EXTENDS the existing license** (plan / `duration_days` / `expiry_date` / `last_renewed_at` / `renewal_history`) — never a replacement. The renewal license key is bound to the order SERVER-SIDE in `orders.notes` and re-read at pay time (never trusted from the client).
- **OTP before payment where applicable**: buy and renew both require a verified OTP (purpose `purchase`) before `order/create` succeeds.
- **Public storefront untouchable**: `/api/v1/store/*` and `/api/v1/checkout/*` are re-used read-only (catalog + checkout config); they are never modified. `lib/store/checkout.ts` is imported/called, never edited.
- **SDK integration**: `Buy License` opens `store.buy_url`; `Renew License` opens `store.renew_url` (config/api-config.json) via `config.get_buy_url/get_renew_url` and `ULC._open_store/_open_renew_portal`. No placeholder URLs.
- **Publisher auto-populates portal URLs during SDK generation**: `ConfigBuilder` (`app/internal/publisher/config-builder.ts`) always writes a `store` section into the generated `config/api-config.json`, deriving `buy_url`/`renew_url` (and `url`) from the configured API base URL (`WEBSMITH_API_URL`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`), i.e. `<base>/internal/api/buy`, `<base>/internal/api/renew`, `<base>/software-store`. No hardcoding, no placeholders, no empty strings. `sdk-validator.ts` fails generation if `store.buy_url`/`store.renew_url` are missing/empty.
- **Contact Sales entry (Email Center Separation)**: `/internal/api/buy` and `/internal/api/renew` render a **Contact Sales** header button (`app/internal/api/portal/_ContactSales.tsx`, passed into `PortalShell` via its `headerAction` slot in `_ui.tsx`) that opens the SHARED `UniversalEmailDialog` in **customer mode** (`customerMode`, `defaultAction`/`allowedActions` restricted to `buy-license`|`renew`) prefilled from the visitor's entered identity. Never duplicate the email form/dialog; never add a portal email entry that posts to `/internal/backend/admin/communication/*`.
- **Contact Sales recipient is server-controlled**: customer-mode sends POST to the PUBLIC `POST /api/portal/support-message` — the action→recipient map lives SERVER-SIDE (buy-license / renew → `sales@websmithdigital.com`); the browser can never supply an address, and no admin endpoint is made public.
- **`POST /api/portal/support-message`** (public, outside the `/internal/:path*` proxy matcher): validates name + email + message server-side (mobile optional, length caps), per-IP throttle, creates `communication_conversations` (category `sales`) + `conversation_messages` (sender `customer`) + `audit_logs`, then sends via the existing `sendEmail()` (`new_sales_enquiry`). Emails are structured (Request Type / Name / Email / Mobile / Subject / Message).
- Keep this rule in sync with the master doc SECTION 0.16.

## Two-Step Login + Shared OTP + Auth Hardening (Session)

Keep in sync with the master doc **SECTION 0.17**. Never regress:

- **One shared OTP UI**: `components/shared/OtpVerification.tsx` is the ONLY OTP verification UI in the repo, used by BOTH login entry points — the public website login (`/login`) and the Internal API Center login (`/internal/api/auth/login`). It is presentational only: 6-digit boxed input (paste + auto-advance + backspace), resend countdown, error display, loading states, "Use password instead" back action; every server call is delegated via `onVerify(otp)` / `onResend()` props returning `{ success, error?, expires_in? }`. No client-side `verified=true` trust.
- **Two-step login — both entry points**: credentials are checked FIRST (`POST /internal/backend/api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/login`), and on success the server sends a login OTP and returns `{ success, requires_otp: true, email, email_masked, expires_in }` WITHOUT any token/cookie. NO session is ever created at the credentials step — it is created ONLY in the verify step. Internal verify: `POST /internal/backend/api/auth/login/otp/verify` (issues `api_center_token` cookie + JWT, updates `last_login`, records the login `notifications` row). Website verify: `POST /api/auth/login/otp/verify` (returns `{ token, user }` → `setAuthSession`). Resend: `POST /internal/backend/api/auth/login/otp/resend` + `/api/auth/login/otp/resend`.
- **Login OTP purposes** (`lib/otp/login-otp.ts`, parameterized `sendLoginOtp/verifyLoginOtp`): website login = `website_login`, Internal API login = `api_login` — each distinct from `password_reset` and `purchase` so `otp_verifications` `UNIQUE(email, purpose)` never collides. 5-minute expiry, max 15 attempts, per-IP send throttle, honest audit rows (`login_otp_sent` / `login_otp_verified`). Emails go through `@/lib/email/brevo` `sendEmail` only.
- **Proxy `PUBLIC_PATHS` is the allow-list, nothing more**: only auth entry routes, health, SDK-facing endpoints (`license/status`, `licenses/validate|activate|deactivate|reactivation/reactivation/submit`, `trials/start|status|analyze|convert|journey|register|suspicious`), storefront (`store`, `store/products`) and `store/enquiries` **POST only** (public contact form; the admin GET listing is behind the gate via a method-split in `proxy.ts`), plus the portal pages `/internal/api/buy` and `/internal/api/renew`. Admin-only endpoints (`admin/trials`, `admin/trials/trial-templates`, `test-sms`, `admin/cleanup`, and GET `store/enquiries`) are NO LONGER in `PUBLIC_PATHS` — direct unauth access returns 401; logged-in admins pass via the `api_center_token` cookie. Never add an admin-only endpoint to `PUBLIC_PATHS`.
- **Portal pages are public at the proxy**: `/internal/api/buy` + `/internal/api/renew` are in `PUBLIC_PATHS` so the standalone customer portal loads WITHOUT an admin login gate (matches `isPortalPage` in `app/internal/api/layout.tsx`).
- **`?next=` is preserved**: `proxy.ts` redirects unauthenticated page loads to `/internal/api/auth/login?next=…`; the login page parses `next` from `window.location.search` (avoiding `useSearchParams`/Suspense) and returns the user there after OTP success; default fallback `/internal/api/dashboard`.
- **Websmith Website Session is STEP 1 for the Internal API Center**: the Internal API login (`/internal/api/auth/login`) is gated by the proxy via `hasValidWebsiteSession(request)` — it verifies the `ws_session` cookie (the mirrored website JWT, signed with `JWT_SECRET`, written by `setAuthSession()`/cleared by `clearAuthSession()` in `lib/auth.ts`; EVERY auth call site syncs both `token` + `ws_session` together). Without a valid website session the internal login NEVER renders: page loads get the standalone **"Please Login First"** page (`app/internal/api/auth/please-login/page.tsx`, only CTA = explicit **Login** button → public `/login`; it never exposes the internal login form or proxy-protected links), and `/internal/backend/*` requests get `401 {success:false, error:"Unauthorized - Please login"}` (JSON) — both via `pleaseLoginFirstResponse`. Missing `api_center_token` but a valid `ws_session` → redirect to `/internal/api/auth/login?next=…` (step 2 continues). After website login, admins enter via **Admin Dashboard → API Center** (`/internal/api/auth/login`) and continue the existing two-step Internal login (credentials → login OTP → `api_center_token`); an expired Internal session mid-use is blocked and sent back to the `/login` flow. Never render the Internal API login (or bypass the website gate) without a valid `ws_session`.
- **Shared helpers**: `lib/website-auth.ts` owns `toPublicUser` + `signToken` (website JWT) so the website login and its OTP verify routes share the same token/user contract.
- Keep this rule in sync with the master doc SECTION 0.17.

## Email Center Separation + Email Form Cleanup (UI-only)

Keep in sync with the master doc **SECTION 0.16** + Progress Tracking ("Email
Center Separation + Email Form Cleanup"). Never regress:

- **No user-facing Email Center entry points in the admin chrome**: the Topbar email icon and the Activation Center shortcuts (Contact Sales / Request Trial / Open Email Center) were REMOVED. The shared `UniversalEmailDialog` stays available to ADMIN flows (LicenseManagerTab, GenerateLicenseTab, sales/enquiries, Communications Center, manage-mails, integrations). Never re-add an Email Center button to the global Topbar or to the customer-facing Activation Center.
- **Buy / Renew customer contact = the Buy & Renew Portal only**: `/internal/api/buy` and `/internal/api/renew` carry the **Contact Sales** header entry (`_ContactSales.tsx` + `PortalShell` `headerAction`). It opens the SHARED `UniversalEmailDialog` in `customerMode` — NEVER duplicate an email form, NEVER add a second email dialog component.
- **Recipient is server-controlled**: customer-mode sends POST to the PUBLIC `POST /api/portal/support-message`; the action→recipient map lives server-side (buy-license / renew / software-store → `sales@websmithdigital.com`; send / activate / reactivation / device-replacement / support / general → `support@websmithdigital.com`). The browser can never target an arbitrary address; `/internal/backend/admin/communication/send|reply` must NEVER be made public.
- **User→admin forms require identity**: every user→admin action (send, buy-license, renew, activate, reactivation, device-replacement, support, general) shows **Your Name\* / Your Email\*** + optional **Mobile** and validates Name + Email before sending; the email body is STRUCTURED (Request Type / Name / Email / Mobile / Subject / Message). Buy License + Renew route to `sales@`; General Support / Support Request / Device Replacement stay `support@`.
- **`POST /api/portal/support-message`** validates server-side (name/email/message, length caps), throttles per-IP, creates `communication_conversations` (category `sales` or `support` per action) + `conversation_messages` (sender `customer`) + `audit_logs`, and sends via `sendEmail()` (`new_sales_enquiry` for sales actions, `admin_notification` for support actions). Email History is newest→oldest (server `ORDER BY created_at DESC` + client-side sort in the dialog).
- **Storefront untouched (one approved Email Center exception)**: `/software-store`
  and `/api/v1/store/*` are never edited for email entry points EXCEPT the ONE
  approved **Software Store Email Center header entry**: an Email icon beside the
  existing Wishlist and Cart icons in the `/software-store` header opens the
  SHARED `UniversalEmailDialog` in `customerMode` — the FULL existing customer
  Email Center (every `actionConfig` action EXCEPT the admin-only `history`,
  no `defaultAction`/`allowedActions` restriction; prefilled from the store's
  known customer identity where available) — and posts to the PUBLIC
  `POST /api/portal/support-message` with the recipient resolved SERVER-SIDE
  (buy-license / renew / software-store → `sales@websmithdigital.com`;
  send / activate / reactivation / device-replacement / support / general →
  `support@websmithdigital.com`). The store theme follows the portaled modal
  via `themeStyle` (`UniversalEmailDialog`) → `containerStyle`
  (`components/ui/Modal.tsx`). Cart / Wishlist / product cards / search /
  filters / checkout / payment / pricing / `/api/v1/store/*` / `/api/v1/checkout/*`
  and all store database logic remain untouched. No `mailto:`, no `/contact`
  redirect, no duplicate email form, no admin endpoint.
- Keep this rule in sync with the master doc.

## Public Homepage Technology Banner (Websmith Landing Page)

Keep `app/page.tsx`'s `FloatingTechnologyBanner` aligned. Never regress:

- **50 technology nodes roam the FULL banner field** (`techSeed` = jittered
  10×5 grid spread across the entire field at init, not one side). Each node
  carries independent `x/y/vx/vy/base/rot/spin/turnTimer/turnEvery/wander`.
  Motion is real 2D physics on `requestAnimationFrame`: independent velocity,
  per-node turn timers (random ±0.8 rad direction changes for zig-zag), wall
  bounces on all four edges (axis-flip + small random deflection so paths never
  repeat), circle-to-circle **elastic collisions** (`collide()`: separate
  overlapping circles first, then reflect velocity along the collision normal,
  never permanent overlap), and a speed clamp that **restores a minimum
  velocity** (`MIN_SPEED`) so no node stalls or clusters. Positions are applied
  via `translate3d` only (GPU-friendly, no per-frame React re-render, no
  physics library). The JS transform is the SOLE positioner — nodes are
  `left:0/top:0` and fully offset by `translate3d(x - radius, y - radius)`;
  never re-introduce `left/top` percentages + `translate3d` together (that
  double-offset caused the old right-side clustering).
- **Each node is a real anchor**: `<a>` with `target="_blank"` and
  `rel="noopener noreferrer"` opens the technology's OFFICIAL website in a NEW
  TAB. Every one of the 50 `TECHNOLOGIES` entries has a verified official
  `href` (official domains/docs only — e.g. Python → python.org, TypeScript →
  typescriptlang.org, React → react.dev, Go → go.dev, C → WG14 standards page,
  Bash → gnu.org/software/bash, Objective-C → Apple docs). Never `href: null`,
  never Wikipedia/tutorials/third-party icon pages, never invented URLs.
- **Presentation preserved**: heading, subtitle, circular masks, icon assets,
  hover zoom/glow, `prefers-reduced-motion` (animation fully stopped when
  reduced motion is active), IntersectionObserver pause when off-screen, and
  ResizeObserver re-clamping on resize all stay intact. Keep this rule in sync
  with `README.md`.

## Admin Messages — Query Inbox (Public Website, AWS-01 R01)

Keep in sync with the master doc **Progress Tracking ("Admin Messages Query
Inbox — Fresh Redesign (AWS-01 R01)" + "Admin Messages Query Inbox — Two-Way
Conversation + Inbound Email + Public Email Branding Cleanup (AWS-01 R01)" +
"Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 Phase 2: Workflow + Backend Logic Completion
(AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-16)" + "Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 Phase 3: Incoming
Email → Chat Final Fix (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-16)") entries**. Never regress:

- **Boundary**: this feature touches ONLY the public admin page
  `app/admin/messages` (client component), its `core/services/ticketService.ts`
  API layer, the `app/api/tickets/*` backend routes, `lib/tickets/email.ts`
  (shared ticket email/template logic), `core/services/clientPortalGreeting.ts`,
  and the public Get in Touch → Query Inbox connection. NEVER touch
  `/internal/api/*`, the Communications Center, mailboxes, auth, notifications,
  the storefront, or the public website beyond the Get in Touch form.
- **Workflow invariants (R01 Phase 2)**: a Get in Touch submission creates ONE
  ticket with `status:"open"` — it appears under Active, shows Open, is
  selectable, and nothing ever auto-closes / auto-resolves / auto-mutates it.
  Close/Open is MANUAL ONLY via `PUT /api/tickets/[id]/status`. The UI derives
  its Open/Close + read-only state from `status` ONLY (never `chatStatus` —
  the backend keeps the fields in sync, the UI never reads the second field).
  The thread renders CLIENT/ADMIN bubbles from `messages[]` (client left, admin
  right, chronological; green "Sent via email" / red "Email failed" + error
  title / amber "Stored, not emailed" indicators; `via email` tag on inbound
  email entries) and falls back to the history timeline only for pre-R01
  tickets. The Resolution Summary editor stays reachable in the selected
  conversation at ANY status (incl. right after Close — the pinned ticket keeps
  the thread + editor open) and the Resolution Email NEVER auto-closes.
- **Get in Touch never auto-delivers credentials**: the public contact
  submission (`POST /api/tickets/public`) only creates the Query Inbox
  conversation. The ONLY credential-delivery path is the admin "Send
  Credentials" button (`POST /api/tickets/[id]/send-client-portal-access`),
  which reuses or creates the client account via `createClientAccount` and
  renders the DB `client-portal-onboarding` template. Temporary passwords are
  securely generated, bcrypt-hashed, NEVER stored/logged, returned once in the
  response, require first-login change, and existing client passwords are never
  overwritten. "Send Resolution Email" NEVER creates accounts and NEVER
  delivers credentials. The Send Credentials button (loading + success/error
  states, "Create Account & Send Credentials" when no account exists) sends
  ONLY on the explicit admin click and the UI NEVER displays the password —
  no `send-credentials` endpoint exists (the existing route performs the
  capability safely; never duplicate it).
- **No internal markers in customer output**: `-- Client Portal Greeting --` /
  `-- End Client Portal Greeting --` markers exist ONLY as admin-side insertion
  anchors; every customer-bound email body passes through `stripAdminMarkers`.
  The greeting itself is the marker-free shared builder
  `core/services/clientPortalGreeting.ts` (professional, editable,
  portal-login block + "The Websmith Digital Team" sign-off).
- **Query Inbox list**: server-side pagination (`QUERY_INBOX_PAGE_SIZE = 15`,
  `page`/`pageSize`/`limit`, `hasMore`/`total`) + escaped-regex `search`
  AND-combined with the role scope (client/developer `$or` can never widen) +
  `scope=active|closed`; soft-deleted rows (`deletedAt`) are excluded from
  every view, never shown.
- **Delete is soft-delete**: `DELETE /api/tickets/[id]` sets
  `deletedAt`/`deletedBy` + `status: closed` + `chatStatus: closed` + a
  `deleted` history entry — real customer history is never permanently
  destroyed.
- **Resend uses the stored snapshot**: admin replies and resolution/onboarding
  emails store `recipient`/`subject`/`emailBody` at send time;
  `POST /api/tickets/[id]/resend` re-sends exactly that snapshot (never
  stale/arbitrary UI text).
- **Resolution Email block rule**: `renderResolutionTemplate` renders the
  `{{temporary_password}}` block only when a temporary password is present and
  the Client ID block only when a client account exists; empty blocks are
  omitted (no placeholder leakage).
- **Two-way conversation = `messages[]` on the same ticket** (canonical thread,
  no second system): Get in Touch (`POST /api/tickets/public`) seeds the initial
  client message + `lastClientReplyAt` + `adminReadAt:null`; admin replies,
  resolution-email, onboarding and resend append outbound entries carrying the
  Brevo `providerMessageId` + honest `deliveryStatus` (`sent`/`failed`/
  `not_sent`); `history` stays the audit log (Resend snapshots, status changes).
  The Query Inbox renders CLIENT/ADMIN bubbles from `messages` and falls back to
  the history timeline for pre-R01 tickets.
- **Inbound email is a BRIDGE over the universal receive system — never a
  second receiver** (`POST /api/tickets/inbound`): the platform's ONE inbound
  receiver is the UNIVERSAL Websmith email receive system (mailbox IMAP sync
  `POST /internal/backend/mailboxes/[id]/sync` + public `POST
  /api/portal/support-message`), which stores every processed customer inbound
  message in the license-system PostgreSQL tables `communication_conversations`
  / `conversation_messages`. The Query Inbox route reads those ALREADY
  PROCESSED customer messages READ-ONLY via `getDb` (`sender_type='customer'`,
  `is_internal IS NOT TRUE`, non-deleted conversations, newest `BRIDGE_BATCH_LIMIT`
  200 per pass), matches each one to the client's existing ticket
  (identity-first: conversation customer email == ticket `contactEmail`, NEVER
  subject alone; thread-identity tiebreak = normalized subject match, then
  newest `updatedAt`), and appends the message to `messages[]` + `client_reply`
  history + `lastClientReplyAt`, reopening `closed → in_progress`. Dedupe is by
  the source PostgreSQL `conversation_messages.id` stored as `sourceRef`
  (`cm:<id>`) + a body/timestamp content guard; bodies pass through
  `cleanInboundBody` at bridge time; attachment BYTES are copied from
  `conversation_attachments.content` into the shared `uploads` collection and
  linked to the message; the conversation's `created_at` timestamp is
  preserved. No mailbox row/credential/SMTP/IMAP/schema is ever touched; no
  `imap`/`mailparser` here.
- **Unread is server-derived**: `GET /api/tickets` returns `hasNewClientReply` =
  `lastClientReplyAt > adminReadAt`; `POST /api/tickets/[id]/read` stamps
  `adminReadAt`; the UI auto-marks read on open and shows unread dots on rows.
- **Public email branding is generic**: `lib/email/brevo.ts` `wrapHtml`
  header/footer never hardcode a product line ("License Management") — a
  configurable `BRANDING_TAGLINE` (default "Software Development & Client
  Support") is used. Internal API email templates and license-specific copy are
  untouched.
- **Customer email rendering is clean**: customer message text is rendered
  through the pure helpers `renderCustomerMessageHtml` /
  `renderCustomerMessagePlain` in `lib/tickets/email.ts` (Markdown tables →
  real HTML tables / separator rows stripped, HTML escaped) — no raw `| :-: |`
  markup ever reaches a customer.
- **Resolution stays reachable after Close**: the Query Inbox pins a just-closed
  conversation so the Resolution Summary editor + Resolution Email remain
  enabled and usable right after Resolved/Closed.
- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 Phase 3: Incoming Email → Chat Final
  Fix (AWS-01 R01)**: completes the client-email → Messenger Chat direction.
  (1) **Admin identity**: every displayed admin name that is missing/generic
  (`"Admin User"`, `"Websmith Team"`, `"Websmith Support Team"`, `"Websmith
  Support"`, `"Support Team"`, or empty) is normalized at RENDER TIME to
  **"Websmith Digital Support"** (`ADMIN_SENDER_LABEL` in
  `app/admin/messages/AdminMessagesClient.tsx`); a real admin name is
  preserved. This is UI-only — outbound Brevo `from`/`name` (via
  `lib/email/brevo.ts`) is untouched, so outgoing chat→client email keeps the
  real receiving-account identity. (2) **Body-only in chat**: the inbound
  email is stored with `message` = `parsed.text || parsed.html` only — the
  email envelope/header/signature-auth metadata is never persisted or
  rendered (existing dedupe by Message-ID + chronological `messages[]`
  ordering ensure the client reply appears once). (3) **Incoming
  attachments**: `POST /api/tickets/inbound` reads `parsed.attachments`,
  stores the attachment BYTES in the shared `uploads` collection
  (`storeInboundAttachments`, max 10MB, shared `validateAttachmentFiles`
  policy) and links them to the new `conversation_messages`/`messages` row
  (`attachments: [{name,url,size,contentType}]`); the ORIGINAL email (with
  its attachments) stays in the support mailbox untouched (IMAP opened
  READ-ONLY, never marks Seen / never deletes) so it "reaches
   `support@websmithdigital.com`" directly, and the stored bytes guarantee
   the chat rendering can never lose the attachment. The Messenger Chat
   renders a compact, read-only attachment indicator (name + size +
   `GET /api/uploads/<id>` download link) — no composer/resend UI for
   inbound attachments. (4) **Auto-poll for live chat** (`AdminMessagesClient.tsx`): when a conversation is open, a 30-second silent interval polls the existing `/api/tickets/inbound` IMAP sync; if new client messages are matched (`result.matched > 0`), the open thread is refreshed via `refreshOpenTicket()` so the reply appears in Messenger Chat immediately — no manual Sync Inbound click required; the manual button remains for immediate sync. (5) **Reply Thread + Resolved Preview clear on send** (`AdminMessagesClient.tsx`): after `handleReply` succeeds, `setGreetingKey("")` is called alongside `setReply("")` so the "Resolved Preview" card is removed (not left stale); selecting a new template re-generates the preview from ticket data, and the custom-edited textarea content is what gets sent — one reply = one outgoing email. Files: `app/admin/messages/AdminMessagesClient.tsx`. Verified: `npx tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0, `npx next build` EXIT 0.
- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 Phase 4: Inbound Email → Chat auto-sync (3s) + mailbox routing fix (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-17)**: the client email reply now appears in Messenger Chat automatically within ~3 seconds and the reply→support@ routing dependency is closed in code. (1) **Sync Inbound button REMOVED** (`AdminMessagesClient.tsx`) — the Query Conversation header no longer has the manual button; only the silent background auto-poll remains (no toast, no visible loader). (2) **Auto-poll every 3 s**: `POLL_INTERVAL_MS = 3_000`, first poll ~800 ms after open; polls ONLY while a conversation is selected AND `status !== "closed"`; stops on deselect/unmount; an in-flight ref guard (`pollInFlight`) never lets two IMAP sweeps overlap; transport switched to `quietFetch` (`syncInboundEmail` in `core/services/ticketService.ts`) so a session expiry can never kill the page and the poll is fully silent — refresh (`refreshOpenTicket()`) happens only when `matched > 0`. (3) **Chat bubble shows ONLY client name + body + timestamp + attachment link** for inbound client email — `senderEmail` and the "via email" tag are no longer rendered on client bubbles (admin delivery indicators unchanged); bodies are cleaned at STORE time by `cleanInboundBody()` in `app/api/tickets/inbound/route.ts` (quoted `>` blocks, "On … wrote:", `-----Original Message-----`, Outlook `From:/Sent:/To:` header blocks, `--` signatures, "Sent from my iPhone/…") plus a display-only client mirror (`cleanClientBody`) for pre-fix stored rows; duplicate protection (Message-ID dedupe) and chronological ordering unchanged. (4) **Inbound sync hardening** (`inbound/route.ts`): each poll processes only the NEWEST `MAX_UNSEEN_BATCH` (40) UNSEEN messages so the 3 s poll stays light with a backlog (mail is opened READ-ONLY, never marked Seen; dedupe makes re-processing harmless); a module-level in-flight guard skips overlapping syncs (`skipped:true`); the sender fallback now honors thread identity — among the sender's tickets the one whose normalized subject matches the inbound subject (Re:/Fwd: stripped) wins, newest-updated tiebreak (NEVER subject alone; sender match is still the gate). (5) **Reply → support@ routing dependency fixed in code** (`app/api/tickets/[id]/replies/route.ts`): the admin reply's From is resolved by `resolveReplySender()` to an **enabled PostgreSQL `mailboxes` row whose address equals the resolved support address** (Manage Page `contact_info.email` → env fallback → `support@websmithdigital.com`) and passed as the existing `sendEmail` `from` override — so the client's reply loops back to support@ and enters the UNIVERSAL receive system (Client → support@ → universal receive → bridge → ticket → Messenger Chat). When no enabled mailbox matches, the default support sender is used unchanged. Honest mailbox dependency: the inbound parser reads ONLY enabled PG `mailboxes` (IMAP READ-ONLY, UNSEEN); if support@ mail does not land in such a mailbox (MX/forwarding or credentials), the route reports it and the chat shows no inbound message — no fake mailbox state anywhere. Files: `app/api/tickets/inbound/route.ts`, `app/api/tickets/[id]/replies/route.ts`, `core/services/ticketService.ts`, `app/admin/messages/AdminMessagesClient.tsx`. Verified: `npx tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0, `npx next build` EXIT 0, cleaner 8/8 unit samples. NOT deployed; awaits user approval + live mailbox verification (real external Gmail/Outlook reply).
- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 Phase 5: FINAL FAST INBOUND CHAT — 1-second poll (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-17)**: the auto-poll interval is now **every 1 second** (`POLL_INTERVAL_MS = 1_000` in `app/admin/messages/AdminMessagesClient.tsx`, first poll ~800 ms after open) so a client email lands in Messenger Chat within **≤1 s** and never later than the **3-second maximum** — the 3-second polling interval was deliberately NOT used. Everything else from Phase 4 is unchanged and preserved: no manual Sync button, no page refresh, no admin action; the silent background poll runs only while a conversation is selected AND not closed (client `pollInFlight` ref guard + server `syncInflight` guard never overlap); `quietFetch` transport so a session expiry can never kill the page; refresh (`refreshOpenTicket()`) only when `matched > 0`; body-only clean client bubbles (name + body + timestamp + attachment link); Message-ID dedupe; chronological order; existing ticket/client identity; outgoing Chat→client email (`[id]/replies` From resolves to the enabled mailbox whose address equals the resolved support address — `contact_info.email` → env fallback → `support@websmithdigital.com` — so the client's reply loops back to support@ and enters the UNIVERSAL receive system (bridge → ticket → Messenger Chat)), templates, client ID, temporary credentials, the existing ticket/message system, and the existing UI/UX all preserved. Production dependency (code-verified, Phase 2 FINAL): the bridge reads ONLY ALREADY-PROCESSED universal customer messages (PostgreSQL `conversation_messages`); support@ mail reaches the app through the universal receive system (mailbox IMAP sync + portal support-message), never through a second receiver. Files: `AdminMessagesClient.tsx` (interval + comments), `core/services/ticketService.ts` + `app/api/tickets/inbound/route.ts` (comment sync only). Verified: `npx tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0, `npx next build` EXIT 0. Deployed 2026-08-17.
- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 FINAL FIX: Brevo Inbound Webhook for native support@ (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-17)**: support@websmithdigital.com is a NATIVE system account (`IMAP = n/a`, `Sync = n/a`), so the IMAP poller can NEVER receive client replies — the app previously had NO inbound receiver for native mail at all (verified: `websmithdigital.com` MX = `mx1/mx2.privateemail.com` — support@ is a real inbox there; Brevo is send-only). The fix is the minimum **Brevo inbound parsing webhook**: `POST /api/brevo/inbound` (`app/api/brevo/inbound/route.ts`, public but token-gated — `x-inbound-token` header or `?token=` must equal the `BREVO_INBOUND_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` env var; env missing → 503 with an explicit "not configured" message, mismatch → 401) receives Brevo's `inboundEmailProcessed` payload (`items[]`, PascalCase: `MessageId`/`InReplyTo`/`From{Address,Name}`/`To[]`/`Recipients[]`/`SentAtDate`/`Subject`/`RawTextBody`/`RawHtmlBody`/`Attachments[{Name,ContentType,ContentLength,DownloadToken}]`/`Headers`), processes ONLY items addressed to the support account (`isSupportRecipient`: the resolved support address `contact_info.email` → `MAIL_SUPPORT_ADDRESS` env → `support@websmithdigital.com`, or `support@*.websmithdigital.com` — sales@/no-reply@ never matched; self-sender and non-support items skipped), downloads attachments via Brevo `GET /v3/inbound/attachments/{downloadToken}` (10 MB cap, best-effort), and feeds EVERY item through the SAME shared pipeline: **`lib/tickets/inbound-core.ts`** (the exact `processInboundEmail`/`cleanInboundBody`/Message-ID dedupe/`storeInboundAttachments`/`messages[]` logic moved verbatim from the IMAP route — the IMAP route `app/api/tickets/inbound/route.ts` now imports it, zero behavior change; ONE pipeline, TWO transports). **UI** (`app/admin/messages/AdminMessagesClient.tsx`): `refreshOpenTicket()` is diff-based (`updatedAt`/`lastClientReplyAt`/`messages.length` — no state churn when unchanged) and the 1-second auto-poll ALWAYS re-checks the open thread after the silent IMAP sync, so webhook-delivered mail (which carries no matched-count signal) appears in Messenger Chat within ≤1 s (max 3 s) with no page refresh and no manual button. Outbound, templates, client ID, temp credentials, resolution, unsubscribe, status logic, "Websmith Digital Support" identity and existing outgoing email are all untouched — admin replies stay `support@websmithdigital.com` only. **External configuration REQUIRED (report to the user, do not invent it)**: (1) `BREVO_INBOUND_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` env var; (2) Brevo dashboard: inbound webhook `type:"inbound"`, `events:["inboundEmailProcessed"]`, `url:"https://www.websmithdigital.com/api/brevo/inbound"`, `domain:"reply.websmithdigital.com"`, header `x-inbound-token: <token>`; (3) DNS: `reply.websmithdigital.com` MX 10 → `inbound1.sendinblue.com.`, MX 20 → `inbound2.sendinblue.com.` (websmithdigital.com MX NEVER touched — the complete original email keeps arriving at support@); (4) support@ (Namecheap Private Email) forwarding rule → `support@reply.websmithdigital.com` (forwarded copy; original stays in the inbox). Verified: `npx tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0, `npx next build` EXIT 0 (294 pages). NOT deployed; awaits user approval + the external configuration.
 - **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 FINAL FIX: REAL inbound transport (read-only IMAP for native support@) + FAST Query Inbox (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-17)**: the Brevo bridge is NOT operational (no MX for `reply.websmithdigital.com` and no `BREVO_INBOUND_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` env → the deployed webhook answers 503), and provider research proved the ONLY real receiving mechanism Namecheap Private Email (Open-Xchange) offers is standard IMAP/POP3 (`mail.privateemail.com:993` SSL) — there is NO inbound webhook and NO message-reading API (Namecheap API = DNS/mailbox CRUD only). Therefore the existing inbound receiver (`POST /api/tickets/inbound`, `app/api/tickets/inbound/route.ts`) now ALSO polls the native support@ mailbox READ-ONLY with provider credentials from env vars (`nativeSupportMailbox()`: `MAIL_SUPPORT_IMAP_HOST` default `mail.privateemail.com`, `MAIL_SUPPORT_IMAP_PORT` default 993, `MAIL_SUPPORT_IMAP_SECURE` default true — set `"false"` for STARTTLS/143, `MAIL_SUPPORT_IMAP_USERNAME` default `MAIL_SUPPORT_ADDRESS` → `support@websmithdigital.com`, `MAIL_SUPPORT_IMAP_PASSWORD` REQUIRED). The SINGLE provider-side dependency is `MAIL_SUPPORT_IMAP_PASSWORD` (the support@ mailbox password from the Namecheap Private Email dashboard — the app never stored native-account credentials); without it the native poll is skipped and the sync summary's `errors[]` reports the exact missing configuration (never silent). The native mailbox flows through the SAME `syncMailbox()` + `processInboundEmail()` pipeline (ticket matching, `cleanInboundBody`, attachment storage, Message-ID dedupe, `messages[]`), opened IMAP READ-ONLY (never marks Seen, never mutates the mailbox → webmail + Internal Communications Center unaffected). Constraints honored: support@/sales@/no-reply@ unchanged, websmithdigital.com MX untouched, NO new mailbox/row, NO schema change, NO IMAP wiring into the Internal API mailbox system (native accounts stay `IMAP = n/a` there); the Brevo webhook route stays untouched but is no longer required. **FAST Query Inbox** (`app/admin/messages/AdminMessagesClient.tsx` + `core/services/ticketService.ts`): (1) the 1-second auto-poll's `refreshOpenTicket()` now uses `getTicketsQuiet()` (quietFetch transport, same response shape as `getTicketsPaged`) so a session expiry can NEVER page-replace the admin mid-poll (the axios interceptor is correct for user actions, never for a silent background poll); (2) every ⋮ action (Open / Close / Delete / Resend) runs independently with a per-action local loading state (`busyAction`/`busyTicketId`: spinner only on the in-flight menu item) and updates the affected card IN PLACE from the full-ticket API response (`applyTicketUpdate`; Delete removes only that card + decrements `total`) — the Query Inbox is never reloaded, no scroll reset, no layout/width change, conversation pane untouched; (3) Send Reply applies the returned updated ticket in place instead of a full list refresh. Ticket selection was already instant (list object, no detail fetch — account card unchanged). Files: `app/api/tickets/inbound/route.ts`, `lib/tickets/inbound-core.ts` (header comment only), `core/services/ticketService.ts`, `app/admin/messages/AdminMessagesClient.tsx`. Verified: `npx tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0, `npx next build` EXIT 0. NOT deployed; awaits user approval + setting `MAIL_SUPPORT_IMAP_PASSWORD` (provider-side dependency) and a real reply test (Client Gmail/Outlook → support@ → read-only IMAP poll → ticket message in Messenger Chat within ≤1 s). 
 - **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 LIVE: env configured, transport verified, deployed (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-17)**: the receive pipeline is now LIVE end-to-end. (1) **Production env configured** — `MAIL_SUPPORT_IMAP_HOST=mail.privateemail.com`, `MAIL_SUPPORT_IMAP_PORT=993`, `MAIL_SUPPORT_IMAP_SECURE=true`, `MAIL_SUPPORT_IMAP_USERNAME=support@websmithdigital.com`, `MAIL_SUPPORT_IMAP_PASSWORD=<support@ mailbox password>` all added to Vercel production (Sensitive) + `.env.local` (never committed; no git diff). (2) **Transport verified with REAL credentials** — read-only login to `mail.privateemail.com:993` (Dovecot IMAP4rev1, authorized TLS cert) PASSED; INBOX opened READ-ONLY; 2 UNSEEN messages parsed via `simpleParser` (UID 23 = self-sent "General Inquiry" from support@, UID 24 = Namecheap welcome mail — NOT client replies); the mailbox was never mutated (never marks Seen). (3) **Pipeline traced + verified** — `app/api/tickets/inbound/route.ts` `nativeSupportMailbox()` + shared `processInboundEmail()` (`lib/tickets/inbound-core.ts`) are the exact code path production polls every 1 s; matching by thread (In-Reply-To/References → `messages.providerMessageId`) then sender fallback, sender ALWAYS verified against `contactEmail`, Message-ID dedupe, `cleanInboundBody`, `uploads` attachment storage, `messages[]` append with timestamp. (4) **Deployed 2026-08-17** — `npx tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0, `npm run build` EXIT 0, `vercel --prod` green; production routes verified live: `POST /api/tickets/inbound` + `GET /api/tickets` answer 401 (auth gate) — no 500s. (5) **Transient Atlas incident observed (NOT code)** — during verification `ac-o1abmjb-shard-00-02.wr0yzts.mongodb.net` (the cluster PRIMARY) intermittently rejected TLS with `tlsv1 alert internal error` (alert 80) from BOTH Vercel and the dev machine, taking all Mongo-backed routes down (`/api/tickets`, `/api/tickets/inbound`, `/api/users/notifications` 500s — `MongoServerSelectionError`); status.mongodb.com showed NO incident; the failure self-resolved within the hour (all 3 shards TLS OK, full-URI connect PASS, writablePrimary = shard-00-02) and production returned to 401-gaited health — no code/env change was made for this. (6) **Final acceptance STILL REQUIRED** — the real end-to-end test: send a reply from a real Gmail/Outlook client (e.g. reply to the admin email on ticket "AI Voice Agent" / keemodatabox@gmail.com, with an attachment) → support@websmithdigital.com → read-only IMAP poll → same Query Ticket → Messenger Chat shows body + attachment + timestamp, no duplicate, within ≤1 s. Outgoing Chat → support@ → client unchanged (`[id]/replies` From = enabled mailbox matching the resolved support address, else default support sender).
 - **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 ROUTING DATA FIX: contact_info swap (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-17)**: the production `settings` document `contact_info` had `email` = **sales@websmithdigital.com** and `sales_email` = **support@websmithdigital.com** (inverted). Since the universal Brevo sender logic derives `support_reply`/`admin_notification`/`conversation_created` From from `contactInfo.email` (`getSupportAddress` in `lib/email/brevo.ts`) and `new_sales_enquiry`/`sales_reply` from `contactInfo.sales_email`, ALL support replies were sent FROM sales@ — so client replies went to the sales@ mailbox, which the Query Inbox inbound poll never reads (it reads native support@ via `MAIL_SUPPORT_IMAP_*` + enabled PG `mailboxes` only). VERIFIED chain (2026-08-17): Brevo accepted both admin replies (`deliveryStatus: "sent"`, messageIds `<202608170628.52498552064@smtp-relay.mailin.fr>` / `<202608170721.40186629963@smtp-relay.mailin.fr>`); support@ INBOX + Spam had ZERO messages since Aug 17; MX probe = `mx1/mx2.privateemail.com`; SMTP RCPT probing blocked by Namecheap. FIX (DATA-ONLY, no code change, no UI, no templates, no Brevo, no MX, no mailbox changes): `$set {"value.email": "support@websmithdigital.com", "value.sales_email": "sales@websmithdigital.com"}` applied to the production `contact_info` record (matched 1, modified 1), applied via a direct-connection probe of the writable primary after a recurring Atlas TLS outage (`tlsv1 alert internal error` alert 80 on `ac-o1abmjb-shard-00-02` — worked with `tlsAllowInvalidCertificates` on the one-shot script only). VERIFIED LIVE: `GET https://www.websmithdigital.com/api/settings/public/contact_info` returns `email: support@websmithdigital.com`, `sales_email: sales@websmithdigital.com` (HTTP 200, 2.4s); `GET /api/tickets` healthy (401, 2.2s). Semantics now universal: support@ = General Support / Query Inbox / TWO-WAY; sales@ = Sales / TWO-WAY; no-reply@ = OTP/system ONE-WAY (no_reply_email empty in contact_info → falls back to `SENDER_EMAIL`/`MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` as before — unchanged). Outstanding: real end-to-end client reply acceptance (send Gmail/Outlook reply → support@ → read-only IMAP poll → same ticket → Messenger Chat ≤1 s, body + attachment + timestamp, no duplicate).
 - **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 PHASE 2 FINAL: Universal Email + Live Query Chat Bridge (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-17)**: the R01 duplicate receivers are REMOVED and the platform is back to ONE universal email receive system. **Removed (R01 duplicate receive implementation)**: `nativeSupportMailbox()` + all `MAIL_SUPPORT_IMAP_*` usage (code + `.env.local` + Vercel production env) + direct Query Inbox IMAP polling (`syncMailbox` over enabled PG `mailboxes`) from `app/api/tickets/inbound/route.ts`, and the whole `app/api/brevo/inbound/route.ts` webhook receiver (deleted; it was never operational — no `BREVO_INBOUND_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`, no `reply.websmithdigital.com` MX). **The Query Inbox NEVER receives email**: the platform's ONE inbound receiver is the UNIVERSAL Websmith email receive system (mailbox IMAP sync `POST /internal/backend/mailboxes/[id]/sync` + public `POST /api/portal/support-message`), which stores every processed customer inbound message in PostgreSQL `communication_conversations` / `conversation_messages`. **The bridge** (`POST /api/tickets/inbound`, admin-only): reads ALREADY-PROCESSED customer messages READ-ONLY via `getDb` (`sender_type='customer'`, `is_internal IS NOT TRUE`, `cc.deleted_at IS NULL`, newest `BRIDGE_BATCH_LIMIT` 200 per pass, processed ascending for chronology), batch-reads attachment bytes (`conversation_attachments.content` BYTEA, best-effort, 10 MB), and for each message `bridgeConversationMessages()` (`lib/tickets/inbound-core.ts` — the ONLY `processInboundEmail`/`InboundMessage`/`collectIds` raw-email pipeline is gone) matches the client's existing ticket (identity-first: conversation customer email == ticket `contactEmail`, NEVER subject alone; thread-identity tiebreak = `normSubject` match, then newest `updatedAt`), dedupes by the source PG id stored as `sourceRef` (`cm:<conversation_messages.id>`) + a body/timestamp content guard for pre-bridge entries, cleans the body at bridge time (`cleanInboundBody`), copies attachment bytes into the shared `uploads` collection + links them, preserves the conversation's `created_at` timestamp, appends `messages[]` + `client_reply` history + `lastClientReplyAt`, and reopens `closed → in_progress`. NO mailbox row/credential/SMTP/IMAP/schema change — no `imap`/`mailparser` here. **UI unchanged** (`AdminMessagesClient.tsx`, `core/services/ticketService.ts`): the 1-second auto-poll (quietFetch, `pollInFlight` guard, silent) calls `syncInboundEmail()` then the diff-based `refreshOpenTicket()` so a client email appears in Messenger Chat within ≤1 s (max 3 s); `ThreadMessage` gained optional `sourceRef`. Outbound Chat→client email unchanged (`[id]/replies` From = enabled mailbox matching the resolved support address — `contact_info.email` → env fallback → support; never hardcoded). Files: `app/api/tickets/inbound/route.ts` (rewritten), `lib/tickets/inbound-core.ts` (rewritten), `app/api/brevo/inbound/route.ts` (DELETED), `core/services/ticketService.ts`, `app/admin/messages/AdminMessagesClient.tsx` (comments only), `.env.local` (MAIL_SUPPORT_IMAP_* removed). Verified: `npx tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0, `npm run build` EXIT 0. NOT deployed — awaits user approval + production env cleanup (`MAIL_SUPPORT_IMAP_*` on Vercel) + real end-to-end acceptance (client reply → support@ → universal receive → bridge → Messenger Chat ≤1 s, no duplicate).
 - **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 NATIVE RECEIVE LIVE FIX: QStash cron + proxy path + IMAP fetch bug (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-18)**: the production native-receive flow was BROKEN at the first hops — the QStash → `/internal/backend/communications/native-receive` chain never ran. (1) **Hop 1 — QStash invocation**: NO schedule existed (QStash `GET /v2/schedules` = 0) AND `proxy.ts` `PUBLIC_PATHS` did not include the native-receive path, so a QStash POST would have been 401'd by the session proxy. FIX: added `/internal/backend/communications/native-receive` to `PUBLIC_PATHS` (QStash-signed system callback — the route's own `verifySignatureAppRouter` is the real security gate) and created the QStash cron via `POST https://qstash-us-east-1.upstash.io/v2/schedules/<url-encoded destination>` with header `Upstash-Cron: * * * * *` (cron in the HEADER, destination in the PATH, body = message payload; scheduleId `scd_75p368ydrEyw33Q6bsJZNjkqMPSG`, `Upstash-Timeout: 60s`, `Upstash-Retries: 3`) — the workspace region is **us-east-1** (the global `qstash.upstash.io` endpoint resolves to eu-central-1 and returns 404 "user not found in this region"; the signing-keys endpoint does not exist via REST — 404 `Cannot GET /v2/signing-keys`). (2) **Hop 3 — IMAP fetch bug in `native-receive/route.ts`**: the route used `imap.on('message', …)` WITHOUT an `imap.fetch()` call, so no message events ever fired and the cycle HUNG forever whenever UNSEEN mail existed (the proven pattern is `mailboxes/[id]/sync/route.ts`: `imap.fetch(uids, { bodies: '', struct: true })` + `fetch.once('end')` → `imap.end()`). FIX: replaced the broken block with the proven fetch pattern; added `export const maxDuration = 60`. (3) **Vercel production env**: the 10 `MAIL_*_IMAP_*` vars were recreated as type `"encrypted"` via the Vercel REST API (delete + POST `{key,value,type:"encrypted",target:["production"]}`) with REAL provider credentials (host `mail.privateemail.com`, port `993`, secure `true`, usernames `support@`/`sales@websmithdigital.com`) and verified via `GET /env/{id}?decrypt=true` + `x-vercel-decrypt: true` — `vercel env add --sensitive` stores vault-type rows that `env pull` shows as literal `[SENSITIVE]` and the API cannot decrypt; never accept `[SENSITIVE]` as verification. **Deployed 2026-08-18**, build green. **LIVE verification (production PG, read-only)**: the cron fires every minute (`native_mail_account_synced` audit rows; 12 cycles/2h, 0 error rows); first fire imported the 32-message backlog (`new=32`), subsequent cycles `new=0, updated=2, skipped≈40` (dedupe re-matches, never duplicates); all 340 stored `conversation_messages` have DISTINCT `provider_message_id` (delta=0); native accounts load from `system_settings.communications.mail_accounts` (support/sales enabled, no-reply disabled); an unsigned POST to the production route now reaches the QStash verifier (403 "`Upstash-Signature` header is missing") instead of the proxy 401. **Bridge hop unchanged**: `POST /api/tickets/inbound` still matches identity-first (conversation customer email == ticket `contactEmail`) — test emails sent FROM `keemogamer@gmail.com` correctly do NOT bridge to the `keemodatabox@gmail.com` tickets (identity-first is by design); the final acceptance test must reply from the ticket's own client address → support@ → Messenger Chat (≤1 s poll). Files: `proxy.ts`, `app/internal/backend/communications/native-receive/route.ts`. No SMTP/send/queue/schema/auth/notification/storefront changes.
- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 CLIENT CHAT VISUAL UPDATE: 550px card + Lanuage Racer Websmith.png left band + 60 programming-icon balloons + random 3× zoom (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-19)**: SUPERSEDES the prior chat visuals in `app/chat/[id]/ClientChat.tsx` (UI-only, single-file diff). (1) **Card**: `min(550px,100%)` × `min(800px,92dvh)`, centered, clear space above/below, decorations never reduced, mobile full-width usable. (2) **Left**: `public/images/Lanuage Racer Websmith.png` (852×1846) fills the left band (far left → card left edge `calc(50% - 275px)`), NO mask/border/crop (`object-fit: contain`), behind card, never inside it. (3) **Right**: exactly **60 × 80px programming-language bubbles** from the REAL icons in `public/wds_icon` (50 Devicon SVGs + 10 core-language repeats = 60; no invented icons; all references verified to exist), random `left 48–98%`, behind card, clear of the left image. (4) **Balloon**: start below viewport → `translateY(-115vh)`, 18–36s, negative random delays, sway ±10px, opacity 0.08–0.24. (5) **NEW random 3× zoom**: JS timer (random 2.3–4.5s) selects ONE bubble → `wsBubbleZoom` `transform: scale(3)` (0.75s in + 1.5s hold + 0.75s out, forwards); next can start during the previous return (transition-only overlap); no reflow, card size unchanged, controls never covered. (6) **Responsive**: below 768px decorations hide (`.ws-hide-mobile`); `prefers-reduced-motion` stops all. Hard boundary: chat API/JWT/status/send/email/Query Inbox/onboarding/DB/login/home untouched — visuals only. Verified: `npx tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0, `npm run build` EXIT 0. NOT deployed; awaits user approval.
- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 LANGUAGE RACER LIVE: 3-track animated racer + Query Inbox controls fixes (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-19)**: SUPERSEDES the prior chat visuals in `app/chat/[id]/ClientChat.tsx` and fixes the Query Inbox card controls in `app/admin/messages/AdminMessagesClient.tsx` (UI-ONLY, two-file diff). **(1) Card chips** — Get in Touch + priority stay on one row, nudged right (`marginLeft 6px`) and +~5px height/width (`padding 2px 8px → 5px 10px`); the priority dropdown is a proper chip-shaped select (`appearance:none` + Websmith-blue chevron data-URI, fixed 25px height, bound value — the old uncontrolled select always showed "Low"). **(2) Info panel** — Get in Touch / priority info opens FIXED + CENTERED in the viewport (`left/top 50% + translate(-50%,-50%)`, `width: min(380px, calc(100vw - 32px))`, `maxHeight: min(72dvh, 460px)` + scroll, sticky centered header; SOURCE INFORMATION = Channel / Email / Company / Submitted / Subject) — never clipped, small screens auto-constrained. **(3) Priority locked** — the card shows a read-only chip (lock icon → opens the priority info panel) until ⋮ menu → **Edit** toggles edit mode (`editModeFor`); in edit mode the select saves via the EXISTING PATCH `{priority}` flow. **(4) Topbar cleaned** — top-level Edit / Delete / Open·Close buttons REMOVED from the conversation topbar; all actions (Open/Close, Edit, Delete, Resend) live ONLY in the existing 3-dot menus; the Edit menu item no longer posts a no-op subject PATCH. **(5) Chat visuals** — the static `public/images/Lanuage Racer Websmith.png` band + 60 balloons + 3x zoom are REMOVED (PNG file deleted) and replaced by a live **Language Racer** on the LEFT: 28 real technology cars + premium **WEBSMITH** car (real `public/wds_icon` Devicon icons + brand colors) on 3 vertical tracks (left bottom→top / center top→bottom / right bottom→top), journey wrappers animate `translateY(100%)↔(-100%)` (GPU transforms only) with per-car deterministic duration 9–16s / negative delays / slots / z-index overtaking / jitter, off-screen extremes = seamless boundary resets; layering track → road glow + dashed lane → car → car glow + trail; `prefers-reduced-motion` stops all. **(6) Mask circle in the card header** — Websmith Digital2.png locked inside `.ws-header-mask` inside the chat card header (44px desktop / 36px mobile, `border-radius:50%` + `overflow:hidden` + `object-fit:cover` — never escapes; Websmith-blue glow ring; NO separate right slot); messenger card UNCHANGED CENTER. **(7) Responsive** — below 1150px tracks/cars shrink via CSS custom properties; below 900px the stage becomes a column with a compact racer strip + smaller in-card mask (36px) — racer never hidden, never overflows, never covers the messenger. No backend/DB/API/token/poll/send changes. Verified: `npx tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0, `npm run build` EXIT 0. NOT deployed; awaits user approval.
- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 CHAT FINAL 3-ZONE: exact 33% / 34% / 33% desktop split — one continuous 4-lane racing road + messenger + restored 60 flying bubbles (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-19)**: SUPERSEDES the prior racer/track visuals in `app/chat/[id]/ClientChat.tsx` (UI-only, single-file diff). **(1) EXACT DESKTOP SPLIT** — the root is a gap-free flex row (no padding/gap): LEFT `33%` / CENTER `34%` / RIGHT `33%` (verified: 528/544/528 at 1600px, zero gap, zones sum to 100%); every zone is `overflow:hidden`, so no element can cross into another zone. **(2) LEFT 33% — ONE CONTINUOUS RACING ROAD** — a single asphalt road fills the full left-column width + full usable height with EXACTLY 4 lanes (Lane 1 ↑ / Lane 2 ↓ / Lane 3 ↑ / Lane 4 ↓ — adjacent lanes always opposite), 2 solid glowing road edges + 3 glowing dashed lane dividers at 25/50/75% (one road, no separated blocks). **16 sport/racing cars** (14 real languages + premium gold **WEBSMITH** car with the Websmith logo — NOT plain rectangles/icons): each is a styled side-profile racer (glowing body in the language's brand color, windshield, rear wing, 2 wheels, direction chevron ▲/▼, real `public/wds_icon` Devicon icon on the body, uppercase label + motion trail). Cars run continuously via per-car journey wrappers (`translateY(110%)↔(-110%)` seamless loop, extremes off-screen), deterministic duration 8–16s, negative delays (mid-road on load), lane slot, z-index pass-over + tiny jitter; cars never leave their lane (lane overflow hidden) and never enter the center. **(3) CENTER 34% — MESSENGER ONLY** — the existing chat card unchanged (messages / composer / Send / Client Login / Home / dynamic Open-Closed status dot + tooltip / secure JWT chat / live 3s poll / in-card Websmith mask circle), vertically + horizontally centered (0px offset, verified), no cars no bubbles. **(4) RIGHT 33% — THE EXISTING FLYING LANGUAGE BUBBLES (RESTORED, never removed/replaced)** — the exact 60-bubble system from the FINAL CHAT UI version: 60 × **80px circular masks** (`border-radius:50%`, `overflow:hidden`, real `public/wds_icon` assets, 50 icons + 10 core repeats), random horizontal positions 4–80% **of the right zone only**, bottom → top `translateY(-115vh)` balloon rise (18–36s, negative delays, mid-flight on load), sway ±10px, opacity 0.08–0.24, continuous looping, PLUS the **random 3× zoom** (JS timer 2.3–4.5s → ONE bubble `scale(3)` 80→240px, 0.75s in + ~1.5s hold + 0.75s out, forwards, transition-only overlap, transform-only no reflow) — all bubbles stay inside the right 33% (zone-clipped). **(5) Responsive** — ≤900px: road + bubbles hidden (`display:none`), center zone 100% width, messenger full-width usable; `prefers-reduced-motion` stops all animations.

- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 CAR TRAFFIC ANIMATION ONLY: 48 moving Websmith cars (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-19)**: SUPERSEDES the car-animation portion of the LEFT RACING ROAD FIX entry in `app/chat/[id]/ClientChat.tsx` (UI-only, single-file diff — ONLY the car generation/rendering + movement/speed logic changed; page layout, track dimensions, lane positions, road edges/dividers, Websmith/F1 road branding, kerbs, checker, footer, typography, colors, bubbles, messenger, backend/APIs/data/routing are ALL untouched). **48 Websmith cars total — 12 cars per lane × 4 lanes** (Lane 1 ↑ / Lane 2 ↓ / Lane 3 ↑ / Lane 4 ↓, directions + track design preserved). Every car carries the **Websmith logo + "WEBSMITH" text EMBEDDED ON the car body itself** (gold gradient body, `ws-car-icon` = `/images/Websmith.png` + `ws-car-brand` text inside the body; the old language-icon/label design and `RACER_CARS`/`ROAD_LANES` data are gone). **Natural traffic behavior**: per-car loop duration 16–26s + negative phase delay + lane slot + one of **6 deterministic speed profiles** (pre-built `wsTrafficUp0-5`/`wsTrafficDown0-5` keyframes whose segment lengths differ — long segments = faster, short = slower — so cars occasionally speed up / slow down); every segment uses `ease-in-out` → **all speed changes smooth, never sudden jumps, never one constant identical speed**; per-car z-index pass-over + wider horizontal jitter keep natural spacing (no stacking); both journey extremes off-screen → **seamless looping**. Cars never leave their assigned lane (`overflow:hidden` lanes + zone) and never enter the center Messenger. Keyframes are injected via a **plain `<style dangerouslySetInnerHTML>` tag** (styled-jsx strips template interpolations — the previous `{TRAFFIC_CSS}` interpolation was silently dropped, freezing all cars; documented so it is never regressed). Files: `app/chat/[id]/ClientChat.tsx` only. Verified: `npx tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0, `next build` EXIT 0, headless-Chrome CDP (1600×900): zone = left 33% full height, 12 cars per lane × 4 = 48, all branded (Websmith text + Websmith.png icon), all 4 lanes' transforms change over time (ALL_MOVING true), 48 distinct transforms (no two cars at the same position). NOT deployed; awaits user approval.
- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 CHAT: CAR ANIMATION REMOVED — left 33% completely blank (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-19)**: SUPERSEDES the entire left-side car/traffic animation in `app/chat/[id]/ClientChat.tsx` (UI-only, single-file diff). **(1) LEFT 33% — COMPLETELY BLANK** — the whole `LanguageRoad` component (racing road, 48 Websmith cars, 6 traffic speed profiles + `wsTrafficUp/Down` keyframes, F1 checkered line, kerbs, road edges/dividers, branded footer strip, websmith_1x1.webp watermark) was removed along with its data (`ROAD_BRAND_IMG`, `TRAFFIC_LANE_COUNT`, `TRAFFIC_CARS_PER_LANE`, `TRAFFIC_PROFILES`, `TRAFFIC_CSS`, `trafficKeyframes`), the `racerRand` helper, the car-only `WEBSCIMITH_LOGO` constant and the `road`/`lane` styles. The left zone is now an EMPTY `<div className="ws-road-zone" style={styles.roadZone} aria-hidden="true" />` — the **33% width allocation is preserved** (`roadZone` style unchanged) so the page layout never shifts. No replacement animation, image, text, placeholder or background was added. **(2) NOTHING ELSE CHANGED** — CENTER 34% messenger, RIGHT 33% flying bubbles + random 3x zoom, card dimensions, typography, colors, backend, APIs, routing and all chat logic untouched; the `@media (max-width: 900px)` rule still hides the (now-empty) `.ws-road-zone` + `.ws-bubble-zone`. Files: `app/chat/[id]/ClientChat.tsx` only. Verified: left-zone DOM contains no car/road elements. NOT deployed; awaits user approval.
- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 LEFT 33% CHAT-STICKER BACKGROUND + SOCIAL POPUPS (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-19)**: SUPERSEDES the left-zone visuals of the SOCIAL ICON WATER-BUBBLE POPUPS entry in `app/chat/[id]/ClientChat.tsx` (UI-only, single-file diff — the EXISTING social popup animation is PRESERVED EXACTLY and now sits on TOP of a new layer; CENTER 34% Messenger + RIGHT 33% flying bubbles + card + typography + colors + backend/APIs/data/routing ALL untouched; the car/traffic animation stays REMOVED). **(1) NEW CHAT-STICKER LAYER** — a second, independent animation layer (`ChatStickers`) inside the SAME left 33% `roadZone`, BELOW the social popups. Colorful illustrated speech-bubble stickers carry a short Websmith support message ("Hey! 👋 We are Websmith." / "Need technical support? 💬" / "Welcome to Websmith! 👋" / … — 10 fixed short messages, random selection), pop in (0 → 1 with a springy overshoot via `wsStickerLife` scale+opacity keyframes), hold briefly, then shrink/fade and are replaced. Every sticker randomizes: **color** (10 vibrant gradient interiors — green/pink/red/orange/blue/purple/teal/amber/indigo/rose), **organic blob shape** (6 blob-like `border-radius` presets, never a plain rectangle), **speech-tail side** (left/right offset diamond with a matching white outline), **rotation** (±7°), **lifetime** (5.5–10s) and **appearance delay** (700–2200ms gap). Each sticker has a **thick white 4px outline**, **soft 3D drop shadow**, **glossy top highlight** (`::before` radial gloss), compact `max-width: 165px`, small readable white text — **every message is contained inside its own sticker; text never floats on the background**. **(2) SAFE PLACEMENT (HARD CONSTRAINT)** — the whole sticker incl. its tail is placed by MEASUREMENT: each pending sticker is mounted hidden, its rotated bounding rect is measured against the real zone (ResizeObserver), then clamped to a random safe position (`STICKER_SAFE` 8px keep-out + 12-position retries with a 16px `STICKER_COLLIDE_MARGIN` so stickers never overlap each other) — nothing is ever clipped or crosses into the center/right. **Max `STICKER_MAX_ACTIVE` = 3** coexist (never fills the area), tracked by a synchronous `activeRef` + `activeIds` Set; every sticker is removed by its lifetime timer and recycled — bounded DOM, no memory growth; unmount-only teardown clears spawn timers + removal timers. **(3) SUBTLE ATMOSPHERE** — a barely-visible `.ws-atmosphere` overlay pulses a slow dim → light brightness (10s alternate, `rgba(255,255,255,0.06)` at 0.3→1.0 opacity) BEHIND the stickers; the existing background stays recognizable, no gradient blobs, no new background image. **(4) LAYER ORDER (exact)** — inside the left zone: existing/default background → subtle dim/light atmosphere → chat-sticker layer → **existing social-media popup layer on TOP** (`SocialIconPops` untouched: same 35 real `public/social_icon` SVGs, 50px base, random safe positions, max 5 active, 0→90px pop, same vanish/replace loop). The `ChatStickers` scene and the pops layer both paint at `z-index: 0` and the pops layer comes LATER in DOM, so popups always stay on top — neither layer replaces the other. **(5) RESPONSIVE + REDUCED-MOTION** — below 900px the `.ws-road-zone` stays `display:none` (measures 0 → no stickers spawned, stickers never touch the full-width messenger); `prefers-reduced-motion` hides the atmosphere + stickers and the spawn loop is skipped. CSS injected via the documented plain `<style dangerouslySetInnerHTML>` tag (`STICKER_CSS`); `scale`/`rotate`/`translate` individual transform properties compose so the life + gentle float animations never fight. Files: `app/chat/[id]/ClientChat.tsx` only. Verified: isolated type-check of the file against React 19 types = 0 errors on all new/existing code (the only 2 remaining diagnostics are the pre-existing `<style jsx>` styled-jsx intrinsics, which resolve in the real project) + esbuild TSX parse EXIT 0. NOT deployed; awaits user approval.
- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 CENTER MESSENGER SKIN POSITION FIX (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-19)**: FIXES the Websmith Messenger skin placement from the FINAL VISUAL FIX entry in `app/chat/[id]/ClientChat.tsx` (UI-ONLY, single-file diff — the skin was a 1px gradient-border WRAPPER (`cardSkin`) AROUND the card, so it read as outside/behind the chat box). The skin is now a **branded header band INSIDE the actual Messenger card**: the `cardSkin` wrapper was REMOVED and `styles.card` is again THE Messenger container (`width min(550px,100%)` / `height min(800px,92dvh)`, radius 22px, subtle `1px solid rgba(20,156,234,0.35)` border + Websmith-blue glow shadow, `overflow:hidden`) containing, top→bottom: the **Websmith skin header** (`styles.header` = diagonal blue gradient band + `inset 0 2px 0` top accent + blue bottom border) with a compact gradient **brand pill** (`styles.skinBrand`/`skinBrandDot`, `.ws-skin-brand` = "Websmith · Digital Support", `#149CEA→#1479EA` pill, white uppercase text, hidden `display:none` under 480px) → the existing title/subject block → the existing right controls (status dot / Client Login / Home / mask circle) → the **existing messages area** (`styles.body`) → the **existing composer** (`ws-skin-input` / `ws-skin-send`). The skin is a real part of the card header/interior — NOT a page background, NOT a wrapper, NOT z-indexed behind the card (no z-index trick used). Messages/composer/functionality/API/routing untouched; LEFT 33% stickers + RIGHT 33% bubbles untouched. Files: `app/chat/[id]/ClientChat.tsx` only.

Bubble size is responsive `clamp(30px,4vw,64px)` via `--ws-bubble-size` (NEVER larger than the original 80px; icon = 82% of size), gentle ±4px sway via `--ws-sway` (keyframes use `var(--ws-sway)`), subtle opacity, `bottom` memoized (never recomputed on re-render so zoom state changes never move bubbles), the random 3× zoom is PRESERVED (now `BUBBLE_COUNT`-scoped, transient + zone-clipped). **(2) LEFT 33% — SLOW READABLE STICKERS** (`ChatStickers`): pacing slowed to `STICKER_MAX_ACTIVE = 2`, `MIN/MAX_LIFE_MS` 10s/16s, `MIN/MAX_GAP_MS` 2.5s/5s; `wsStickerLife` keyframes now SLOW zoom-in (0→12%) + long readable hold (16→86%) + slow zoom-out/fade (94→100%) with gentle `cubic-bezier(0.33,1,0.68,1)` (bouncy easing removed). **(3) LEFT — ZERO OVERLAP / ZERO BLANK POPUPS via SHARED OCCUPANCY** — one shared `Occupancy` map (`occupancyRef`, keys `sticker:<id>`/`popup:<id>`, `OCC_MARGIN` 12px, `occOverlaps()` helper) owned by a new `LeftZoneVisuals` wrapper and passed to BOTH `SocialIconPops` and `ChatStickers`: each social popup CLAIMS a rotation-safe rect (`POP_CLAIM` 108px centered on the 90px bubble) BEFORE showing and spawn retries up to 24 spots, returning null → the 250ms ticker WAITS and retries (never blank, never off-screen, never overlapping); each sticker is measured against the SAME map (popups + other stickers) with up to 24 retries and REMOVED if no safe spot exists (never blank/overlapping) — a placed sticker never moves and fully fades out before any fresh sticker appears (no teleport). **(4) LEFT LAYER ORDER FLIPPED** — stickers are now ON TOP: `.ws-road-zone` renders atmosphere (z-index 0) → `SocialIconPops` (`.ws-social-pops-layer` z-index 0) → `ChatStickers` (`.ws-stickers-layer` z-index 1); the old `.ws-left-scene` wrapper/atmosphere-inside-scene is gone. **(5) CENTER 34% — WEBSMITH MESSENGER SKIN (visual only)** — new `styles.cardSkin` 1px gradient-border wrapper (radius 23px outer / 22px inner, Websmith-blue `#149CEA→#1479EA` glow shadow) around the unchanged `styles.card` (width/height moved to the skin); header gains a blue top accent (`inset 0 2px 0 rgba(20,156,234,.85)`) + blue-tinted gradient background + blue bottom border; body gets a soft radial Websmith-blue glow; client/admin bubbles become blue-tinted Websmith gradients, `bubbleSender` `#149CEA`; composer gains a blue top hairline + subtle gradient; the textarea gets `className="ws-skin-input"` (Websmith-blue focus ring via `.ws-skin-input:focus` in the styled-jsx block) and Send gets `className="ws-skin-send"` (gradient `#149CEA→#1479EA`, glow hover/active/disabled states). `@media (max-width:900px)` + `prefers-reduced-motion` behavior unchanged.

- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 LEFT RACING ROAD FIX: Websmith/F1 branding integrated into the left 4-lane racing road (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-19)**: SUPERSEDES the left-zone visuals of the CHAT FINAL 3-ZONE entry in `app/chat/[id]/ClientChat.tsx` (UI-only, single-file diff — CENTER Messenger + RIGHT 60 bubbles untouched). The LEFT 33% zone keeps **ONE continuous road** (full left-zone width + full usable height, EXACTLY 4 lanes ↑ ↓ ↑ ↓, adjacent lanes opposite, 2 solid glowing edges + 3 glowing dashed dividers at 25/50/75%, no gaps) with **16 sport/racing cars evenly 4/4/4/4** (C, C++, Java, Go, PHP, JavaScript, Rust, Kotlin, Python, TypeScript, Node.js, Swift, React, MongoDB, C# + premium gold **WEBSMITH** car with the Websmith logo — dart swapped for csharp): styled side-profile racers (glowing language-color body, windshield, rear wing, 2 wheels, chevron ▲/▼, real `public/wds_icon` Devicon icon, label + trail), per-car duration 8–16s, negative delays (mid-road on load), lane slot, z-index pass-over + jitter, seamless `translateY(110%)↔(-110%)` loop with both extremes off-screen; lane + zone `overflow:hidden` guarantee cars never enter the center. **Websmith Digital branding is INTEGRATED INTO the asphalt** (all `pointer-events:none`, z-index 1–2, DOM-before-cars so every marking stays BEHIND the cars, never floating UI): (a) large **blurred `public/images/websmith_1x1.webp` watermark** (blur 6px, `mix-blend-mode:screen`, ~26% opacity) down the road centre; (b) vertical F1-style track print `WEBSMITH DIGITAL · GRAND PRIX` down the centreline + secondary `TECHNOLOGY · ENGINEERING · SUPPORT` print near the base; (c) **F1 checkered start/finish line** across the road top (`repeating-conic-gradient` 15px cells + neon glow); (d) **red/white F1 kerbs** along both road edges; (e) thin **branded footer strip** `WEBSMITH DIGITAL — OFFICIAL TRACK PARTNER` + webp logo painted onto the road base. **Dark premium racing asphalt**: deep blue-black base + faint horizontal wear streaks + lengthwise sheen + neon-blue ambient radial glow.

Behind it (z-index 0, pointer-events none, never covers controls): **Websmith Digital2.png** in a **large circular mask** (96–150px, object-fit cover) floating on the LEFT, and **60 language circular bubbles** on the RIGHT that **continuously float bottom → top like balloons** (18–36s, negative delays = mid-flight on load, random horizontal 52–98%, gentle sway, reduced-motion stopped). Header buttons — **Client Login / Home / Open·Closed** — are the **SAME SIZE** (flex:1 × 32px) with **DIFFERENT colors** (blue / green / amber-red; status flips live via the client 3s poll).

- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 PHASE 6: Admin Ticket Card Redesign + Secure Public Client Messenger Chat (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-18)**: (1) **Admin ticket card redesign (UI-only, `app/admin/messages/AdminMessagesClient.tsx`)** — ONE ticket = ONE self-contained card, identical structure for Active and Closed: header row inside the card (Query label + unread dot + ⋮ menu), body (customer name/email, date/time row, status chip `● Open`/`● Closed` from `status` ONLY + source + priority chips, subject/title, 2-line description clamp), footer (Client ID / last activity + quick Open/Close action button). The ⋮ menu keeps every existing action (Open/Close, **Copy Chat Link**, Delete, Resend); old split `cardHeader`/`cardActions`/`ticketRow`/`ticketMeta` styles removed; card styling rides the scoped `.query-ticket-row` CSS. (2) **Secure public Client Messenger Chat** — a separate standalone page (NO admin chrome, NO email, NO new accounts) reachable ONLY via a direct signed link: admin ⋮ → **Copy Chat Link** (`createTicketChatLink(id, origin?)` → ADMIN-ONLY `POST /api/tickets/[id]/chat-link`) produces `/chat/<ticketId>?token=<signed JWT>`. Token signed with the existing website `JWT_SECRET` (`lib/tickets/chat.ts` `signChatToken`/`verifyChatToken`, payload `{purpose:"client_chat", ticketId, email}`, 30-day expiry `CHAT_TOKEN_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`), verified server-side: `payload.ticketId === path id` AND `ticket.contactEmail` (lowercased) `=== payload.email`. `GET/POST /api/tickets/[id]/chat` (public but token-gated): reuses the existing ticket `messages[]` array (`senderType:"client"`, `direction:"inbound"`, `source:"chat"`), stamps `lastClientReplyAt` + `updatedAt`, reopens `closed → in_progress` (+ `chatStatus:"open"`), pushes `history {action:"client_reply", actorRole:"client"}`, in-memory rate limit 10 / 60s per `ticketId:email`; NO email sent — the admin Query Inbox 1s auto-poll surfaces chat messages within ~1s. Response sanitized (`sanitizeChatConversation`): only ticketId/subject/status/contactName/contactEmail/createdAt/messages[{id,senderType,senderName,message,createdAt,attachments[{name,url}]}] — never history/resolution/delivery internals/providerMessageId/sourceRef/clientId. UI: `app/chat/[id]/page.tsx` + `ClientChat.tsx` (Messenger-style: "Websmith Digital Support" header, client-left/admin-right bubbles, attachment links via public `GET /api/uploads/<id>`, 3s silent poll, Enter-to-send, mobile responsive). `/chat` added to `PUBLIC_ROUTE_PREFIXES`; `ClientLayout` `isStandaloneChatRoute` suppresses nav/footer/consent-banner/analytics on chat. No Get in Touch / onboarding / client-account / resolution / reply-thread / email / mailbox changes. Files: `lib/tickets/chat.ts`, `app/api/tickets/[id]/chat-link/route.ts`, `app/api/tickets/[id]/chat/route.ts`, `app/chat/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/chat/[id]/ClientChat.tsx`, `app/admin/messages/AdminMessagesClient.tsx`, `core/constants/routes.ts`, `app/ClientLayout.tsx`, `core/services/ticketService.ts`.

- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 PHASE 3: Client Onboarding auto-create + admin-gated password reveal + blank Resolved Preview + First Welcome template + interactive source/priority chips (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-18)**: (1) **Client Onboarding immediate auto-create** — a successful **Get in Touch** submission (`POST /api/tickets/public`) now creates/reuses the client account (`users` role `client`) via `createClientAccount` (existing `CL-####` sequential Client ID rules) and stamps the ticket `clientId`/`clientCustomId`/`clientAccountSource` (`created`/`existing`)/`clientAccountEmail` at insert time — the **Client Onboarding card in the Query Inbox shows the account immediately** (the UI now loads it via `getTicketClientAccount` when a conversation is opened). NO email is sent and NO temporary password is ever returned to the public caller. (2) **Temporary password is encrypted at rest + revealed only after admin-password verify** — `lib/tickets/email.ts` adds AES-256-GCM helpers (`encryptTemporaryPassword`/`decryptTemporaryPassword`/`resolveStoredTemporaryPassword`, key derived from the existing `JWT_SECRET`, format `enc:iv:tag:data`) and `createClientAccount` stores `temporaryPasswordEnc` on the user doc (bcrypt hash stays authoritative; plaintext never stored/logged). New admin-only `POST /api/tickets/[id]/reveal-password` (`{adminPassword}`) verifies the CURRENT admin password via `bcrypt.compare` (in-memory 5-attempt/10-min per-admin guard, 429) then decrypts — never logged, never in URLs/history/unnecessary responses. `send-client-portal-access` resolves an existing still-temporary account's password from `temporaryPasswordEnc` (never regenerates an existing client's password) and `client-account` GET adds `hasTemporaryPassword`. UI: the onboarding card shows **Reveal Temporary Password** (only when `hasTemporaryPassword`) → inline admin-password prompt → temporary 30s auto-hide reveal + Copy/Hide; never automatic. (3) **Resolved Preview starts BLANK** — no template is pre-selected on mount (the old `setGreetingKey(defaultKey)` is gone) and opening a conversation resets `reply`/`greetingKey`/`resolution`/`resolutionTemplateKey`/chat/reveal state (`handleSelectTicket`; the poll-driven `refreshOpenTicket` never resets); the Reply Thread `<select>` now has a "Select a template..." blank option and selecting a template auto-fills the Reply Thread textarea. (4) **First Welcome Message — professional rewrite + clickable Portal/Chat links (2026-08-19, see the master doc "R01 — First Welcome Message professional rewrite" progress entry)** — the `first-welcome` DB seed template body is now the professional structure: **"Welcome to Websmith Digital"** heading + `Hello {{client_name}},` + "request has reached the right team, and we are pleased to connect with you" + **Client Portal:** `[Client Portal]({{portal_url}})` (`https://www.websmithdigital.com/login`) + **Login Email:** `{{client_email}}` + **Continue Chat:** `[Continue Chat]({{chat_url}})` direct secure Messenger Chat link (wrapped in the existing `{{#if chat_url}}` block so it is dropped when no chat link resolves) + the closing "You can keep the conversation going anytime through your Client Portal or Secure Chat." line + `${SIGN_OFF}`; subject unchanged (`We've received your request - {{request_id}}`). The shared HTML renderer (`renderCustomerMessageHtml` + `renderInlineEmailText` in `lib/tickets/email.ts`) now turns `[label](url)` tokens into clickable `<a>` links (http/https only, HTML-escaped) and auto-linkifies bare URLs — the secure chat JWT lives ONLY in the `href`, never as visible text; `renderCustomerMessagePlain` unwraps tokens to `label: url`, and the First Welcome send (`app/api/tickets/public/route.ts`) passes the unwrapped plain text. `ensureResolutionTemplates` now bulkWrite-upserts missing seed keys (`$setOnInsert`) so new templates reach existing DBs without overwriting admin edits; `{{chat_url}}` is resolved client-side via `createTicketChatLink` (per-ticket cache; fallback = the prescribed customer-facing sentence, NEVER the portal `/login` URL — Continue Chat must open the Messenger Chat directly without login) and server-side via new `buildChatUrl()` in `lib/tickets/chat.ts` (added to `send-resolution-email` + `send-client-portal-access` data). (5) **Get in Touch / priority chips now open info popovers** — the source chip ("Get in Touch") and priority chip ("Medium") on the ticket card are interactive (`role="button"`, stopPropagation) and open a fixed popover with the ticket's EXISTING source info (channel/email/company/submitted/subject) or priority info (label + handling description) — no new backend, no duplicate data, card design preserved. Files: `lib/tickets/email.ts`, `lib/tickets/chat.ts`, `app/api/tickets/public/route.ts`, NEW `app/api/tickets/[id]/reveal-password/route.ts`, `app/api/tickets/[id]/send-client-portal-access/route.ts`, `app/api/tickets/[id]/client-account/route.ts`, `app/api/tickets/[id]/send-resolution-email/route.ts`, `core/services/ticketService.ts`, `app/admin/messages/AdminMessagesClient.tsx`.

- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 FIX: `${COMPANY}` placeholder in the Welcome Email (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-20, see master doc "R01 — FIX `${COMPANY}` PLACEHOLDER IN WELCOME EMAIL" progress entry)**: production welcome emails showed `Welcome to ${COMPANY} - <ticket_id>`. ROOT CAUSE: commit `47c46ae` seeded `first-welcome.subject` as a DOUBLE-QUOTED string `"Welcome to ${COMPANY} - {{request_id}}"` — `${COMPANY}` is JS template-literal syntax, never a renderer token (the renderer only knows `{{...}}`), so the LITERAL placeholder was stored in MongoDB `resolution_templates` and `$setOnInsert` never overwrote the broken production row. FIX (all in `lib/tickets/email.ts`): (1) `first-welcome` seed subject is now **`Welcome to Websmith Digital - {{request_id}}`**; (2) the two other double-quoted seed subjects (`new-project-discussion`, `website-web-application`) use the same template-literal `${COMPANY}` pattern the bodies already use (resolved to "Websmith Digital" at seed time, never stored literally); (3) `ensureResolutionTemplates` now runs a repair `updateMany` that replaces any literal `${COMPANY}` with `Websmith Digital` in stored `subject`/`body` rows (production heals on the next request; only rows containing the placeholder are touched); (4) `renderResolutionTemplate` resolves any residual literal `${COMPANY}` at render time — no template can ever send the literal. Ticket ID / chat URL / login URL / customer data / email layout and all other email flows unchanged; no new files, no duplicate templates. Verification: no literal `${COMPANY}` remains in any seed/template string.
- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 WELCOME MESSAGE REWRITE: new structure + secure chat links (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-20, see master doc "R01 — WELCOME MESSAGE REWRITE: new structure + secure chat links" progress entry)**: the welcome/support message (Get in Touch → `first-welcome` template) now follows the REQUIRED structure — **"Websmith Digital Support"** heading → `Hello {{client_name}},` → "Thank you for contacting Websmith Digital. Your request has reached the right team." → existing-customer Client Portal instruction → business-interest instruction ("You may be asked for your Client ID when continuing with our team") → `Client Portal:` + `[Client Portal]({{portal_url}})` → direct encrypted chat intro → `{{#if chat_url}}Direct Secure Chat: [Continue in Secure Chat]({{chat_url}}) {{/if}}` (label + link INSIDE the guard — unresolvable chat link removes the whole section, no dangling label) → "You can continue the conversation anytime through your Client Portal or Direct Secure Chat." → `${SIGN_OFF}`. **The full signed Secure Chat URL (`...?token=<jwt>`) is NEVER visible text anywhere**: `ensureResolutionTemplates` runs a one-time migration that re-seeds subject+body for any stored `first-welcome` row lacking the canonical **"Direct Secure Chat"** marker ($setOnInsert never touches existing rows); `renderCustomerMessagePlain` unwraps `[label](url)` to label-only when the URL contains `token=` (portal URL, token-free, stays `label: url`); and BOTH chat UIs render stored message text through the NEW client-safe pure module `core/services/messageRender.ts` (`renderMessageHtml`: escape-then-linkify `[label](url)` + bare URLs into `<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">` — URL only in href, HTML-escaped otherwise, no injection) via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with scoped link CSS (`.qib-chat-scroll .qib-msg-text a` in AdminMessagesClient, `.ws-msg-text a` in ClientChat). Storage/history unchanged — legacy stored bodies render label-only, historical duplicates are pre-existing data (single generation path `sendWelcomeEmail`, once per ticket; nothing deleted). Verified: `scripts/verify-message-render.mts` 15/15 + `scripts/verify-welcome-template.mts` 16/16 + `npx tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0 + `npm run build` EXIT 0. Not deployed; awaits user approval.

- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 FINAL FIX: Messenger Chat live real-time updates + clean message display (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-20)**: the Query Inbox Messenger Chat now renders inbound Email and Secure Chat messages within the existing 1-second silent poll with the required hierarchy and without jumping or duplicating. ROOT CAUSE (UI-only): (1) `refreshOpenTicket()` re-fetched the whole 15-ticket `getTicketsPaged` page every second instead of the single open ticket, causing full-list churn and re-render of every card; (2) `ThreadMessage.source` union lacked `"chat"` and `"welcome_email"` so chat-vs-email could not be distinguished at the type level; (3) client name was not rendered above the message and the timestamp/source were not collapsed into the single bottom line. FIX (files: `app/admin/messages/AdminMessagesClient.tsx`, `core/services/ticketService.ts`, `app/api/tickets/route.ts`): (1) added an optional comma-separated `ids` filter to `GET /api/tickets` applied AFTER the role scope / `deletedAt` / status scope (cannot widen access); (2) added exported `getTicketQuiet(id)` (uses the existing `quietFetch` transport so a session expiry can never page-replace the admin) and extended `ThreadMessage.source` to `"email" | "chat" | "welcome_email" | "public_contact" | "portal" | "resolution_email" | "system"`; (3) `refreshOpenTicket` now fetches ONLY the open ticket (`getTicketQuiet(selectedTicket.id)`, diff-based, `useCallback` dep `[selectedTicket]`, no poll-timer changes) and clears the card menu; (4) `ThreadMessage` is rewritten to render **Client First Name** (ticket-generated name `contactName` || `clientId.name`, first token, title-stripped) as the TOP line and `{formatTimeOnly(createdAt)} · {clientSourceLabel(source)}` (`From Email` for `email`/`public_contact`/others, `From Chat` for `chat`) as the BOTTOM line; admin bubble uses `direction==="outbound"` with the existing `formatDate` + green/red delivery indicators unchanged; (5) scroll preservation: `chatScrollRef` + `nearBottomRef` → jump-to-bottom on conversation switch, and on message append pin-to-bottom ONLY when the user was already near the bottom (no forced jump); `onScroll` also closes the ⋮ card menu. No new polling mechanism; the single `POLL_INTERVAL_MS=1000` `syncInboundEmail()` → diff `refreshOpenTicket()` loop is unchanged. Outgoing Chat→client email, the universal receive system, Brevo send, chat-token gen, onboarding, client IDs, resolution templates, and all DB/auth/notification/storefront logic untouched. Verified: `npx tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0; local `npm run build` aborts only at the pre-existing `native-receive` QStash signing-key env step (identical on the untouched baseline). Deployed 2026-08-20 via Vercel production (296 pages, TypeScript green; 5 pre-existing Turbopack dynamic-filesystem warnings in `sdk-validator.ts`/`app/api/v1/communication/[id]/attach/route.ts`, unrelated to this change). Live acceptance test recommended: open a Query Inbox conversation, send a Secure Chat message + a test email reply, and confirm each appears ~1s later with the correct hierarchy (client first name top; `Time · From Chat`/`Time · From Email` bottom) without reload/jump/duplicate.

- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 FAST LOAD + REAL-TIME FIX: lean card list + incremental messages endpoint + single 1s poll (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-20, see master doc "Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 FAST LOAD + REAL-TIME FIX" progress entry)**: fixes the two `/admin/messages` complaints — slow initial load and real-time Email/Secure Chat messages not appearing (silently, within ~1s). ROOT CAUSES: (1) `GET /tickets?scope=&page=&pageSize=` returned the FULL ticket documents (full `messages[]`, full `history[]` bodies, attachments, resolution) for all 15 page rows though the Query Inbox card renders only ~8 fields — the heavy thread payload was downloaded on every list load; (2) the auto-poll restarted whenever `selectedTicket` changed (`refreshOpenTicket` re-created the interval via its `[selectedTicket]` dep) and re-downloaded the WHOLE open conversation every second, so real-time Email/chat updates were flaky. FIX (files: `app/api/tickets/route.ts`, NEW `app/api/tickets/[id]/messages/route.ts`, `core/services/ticketService.ts`, `app/admin/messages/AdminMessagesClient.tsx`): (1) **Lean card list** — `GET /api/tickets?fields=card` projects only the card fields (`CARD_PROJECTION`: id/source/client*/contact*/subject/priority/status/chatStatus/lastClientReplyAt/adminReadAt/createdAt/updatedAt + the three `history.recipient/emailSubject/emailBody` subfields) and adds a server-computed `hasStoredEmail` Resend flag, stripping the `history` array from the payload — the initial load transfers only the light card data. Non-card consumers (`ids` single-ticket refresh, client list) are untouched (backward compatible). (2) **Incremental messages endpoint** — NEW admin-only `GET /api/tickets/[id]/messages?after=<ISO timestamp>` returns ONLY the messages newer than the caller's cursor (ascending) plus lightweight metadata (`updatedAt` / `lastClientReplyAt` / `hasNewClientReply` via the exported `hasNewClientReply` / `status`); `parseObjectId` + existing `apiHandler`/`json`/`badRequest`/`forbidden`/`notFound` contracts; no schema/email/IMAP/chat-infrastructure change. (3) **Single stable 1s poll** — the interval is created ONCE on mount (deps `[applyIncremental, markReadSelected, refreshCardsSilently]`, all `useCallback([])`-stable) and reads the current selection through `selectedRef` (id+status mirrored by a tiny effect, cursor advanced only on real conversation switch) — it NEVER restarts on state updates and never duplicates. Each tick: `Promise.all` the existing silent email bridge (`syncInboundEmail`) + `getTicketMessages(id, cursor)`; appends ONLY deltas via `applyIncremental` (idempotent by message `id` — new id appended once, existing id never re-appended, changed message updated in place) and clears the unread dot via `markReadSelected` when `hasNewClientReply`; a catch-up messages fetch runs after the bridge so a just-bridged email is picked up in the same cycle; when the bridge reports `matched > 0` the lean card list is refreshed silently (`refreshCardsSilently` reads `listStateRef` for scope/page/search, re-fetches `fields=card`, merges card metadata onto the open conversation WITHOUT dropping its thread). (4) **Full thread fetched once on open** — `handleSelectTicket` is async: it sets the lean card instantly, sets `cursorRef` to `now` (so the poll only picks up genuinely NEW messages), then fetches the full conversation via the EXISTING single-ticket `getTicketQuiet` (`GET /tickets?ids=`, quietFetch, full doc — unchanged) and sets `cursorRef` to the max thread time; `threadLoading` shows a one-time "Loading messages..." placeholder in the chat card only on select (never during the silent poll); re-clicking the SAME open card keeps the in-progress draft and does not re-fetch; `loadTickets` passes `fields: "card"` and merges only `CARD_FIELDS` onto the open conversation (full thread/history never lost); the old auto-mark-read-on-open effect is preserved. Verified: `npx tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0; `next build` compiles + TypeScript green and aborts only at the pre-existing `native-receive` QStash signing-key env step (identical on the untouched baseline). Not deployed; awaits user approval.

- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 SEVEN-POINT LIVE FIX: WSD Request ID + email-header cleanup + on-demand native receive + live Get-in-Touch + compact chat (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-21, see master doc "Admin Messages Query Inbox — R01 SEVEN-POINT LIVE FIX" progress entry)**: (1) **Customer-facing WSD Request ID** — every new ticket (Get in Touch + Client Portal) stores a `requestId` (`WSD-XXXXXX`, unambiguous alphabet, collision-checked via `generateRequestId()`/`generateUniqueRequestId(db)` in `lib/tickets/email.ts`) and ALL FIVE customer-facing email paths render it as `{{request_id}}` via `ticketRequestLabel(ticket)` (welcome / reply / resolution / onboarding / resend; pre-WSD tickets fall back to the legacy ObjectId — no migration); shown as chips on the card header, beside the conversation subject and in Client Details, and server-side searchable (`requestId` in `CARD_PROJECTION` + `SEARCH_FIELDS`). (2) **Email header/quote cleanup hardened** — `cleanInboundBody` cuts reply-header RUNS (≥2 consecutive From:/Sent:/To:/Subject:/Date: lines) ANYWHERE (not only after a blank line) and the Gmail `On … wrote:` intro also when directly followed by a quoted block; display-mirror `cleanClientBody` hardened identically. (3) Chat bubble format unchanged. (4) Silent 1s poll preserved (single interval, refs, incremental messages). (5) **Email→chat delay root cause fixed** — the universal native receive core was extracted verbatim into NEW `lib/communications/native-receive-core.ts` (`runNativeReceiveCycle()`); the QStash route is a thin signed wrapper around it, and `POST /api/tickets/inbound` schedules ONE throttled kick of that SAME cycle (`NATIVE_KICK_MIN_MS` 10s guard, executed via `after()` from `next/server`, response never blocked) while an admin polls — support@ mail reaches PostgreSQL in seconds instead of waiting up to 60s for the next cron fire, and the NEXT 1-second tick bridges it. STILL exactly ONE receiver / ONE pipeline (the bridge never touches IMAP or parses mail itself); the QStash cron remains the baseline receiver; Message-ID dedupe makes overlap harmless. (6) **Get in Touch drops live** — with no conversation open/closed selected, the same interval silently refreshes the lean card list every `LIST_REFRESH_TICKS = 5` ticks (~5s) via the existing `refreshCardsSilently()`. (7) **Compact Messenger Chat** — chat card height → `clamp(220px, 34dvh, 420px)` + tighter label row/scroll/bubble paddings; text stays 12px readable. Files: `lib/tickets/email.ts`, `app/api/tickets/public/route.ts`, `app/api/tickets/route.ts`, `[id]/replies` + `[id]/send-resolution-email` + `[id]/send-client-portal-access` + `[id]/resend`, `lib/tickets/inbound-core.ts`, NEW `lib/communications/native-receive-core.ts`, `app/internal/backend/communications/native-receive/route.ts`, `app/api/tickets/inbound/route.ts`, `core/services/ticketService.ts`, `app/admin/messages/AdminMessagesClient.tsx`. No mailbox/SMTP/IMAP-implementation/schema/auth/notification/storefront changes. Verified: `npx tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0; `next build` EXIT 0 (placeholder QStash keys; without them it aborts at the documented pre-existing env step identical to baseline); cleaner unit assertions 9/9; `npm test` 6/6 + 13/13.

- **Admin Messages Query Inbox — R02 LIVE SYNC FINAL: one canonical email cleaner + always-on 1-second sync + live Get in Touch (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-21, see master doc "Admin Messages Query Inbox — R02 LIVE SYNC FINAL" progress entry)**: fixes the four production complaints against `/admin/messages` (quoted email header still shown; email replies not live; Get in Touch tickets not live; unreliable 1-second sync). ROOT CAUSES (verified in code): (1) the quote-intro boundary required `prevBlank || nextQuoted` — real-world mailparser HTML→text output frequently has NEITHER (no blank line above `On … wrote:`, no `>` markers below), so whole quoted emails leaked into chat bubbles, and the client display mirror was a SECOND drifting copy of the cleaner; (2) `refreshCardsSilently()` merged via `prev.map(t => byId.get(t._id) ?? t)` — genuinely NEW tickets could never enter the list, and it ran only every 5th tick when idle and never while a conversation was open; (3) idle mode skipped the bridge entirely, so emails stopped reaching tickets whenever no conversation was selected. FIXES: **(1) ONE canonical cleaner** — NEW pure module `core/services/inboundBodyCleanup.ts` (zero imports, client-safe) owns the entire rule set; the quote-intro cut is UNCONDITIONAL (`^on\b.{0,300}\b(wrote|said):\s*$`, angle brackets optional) plus wrapped two-line intros (`On <date>…` / `…wrote:` tail pair); header-run ≥2, `>` quotes, original-message separators, mobile signatures and `--` rules preserved; `lib/tickets/inbound-core.ts` re-exports it (server API unchanged) and `AdminMessagesClient.tsx` aliases its local mirror to the same function (`const cleanClientBody = cleanInboundBody`) — legacy stored rows are cleaned at RENDER time only, DB never mutated. **(2) Always-on uniform 1-second tick** (`POLL_INTERVAL_MS = 1000`, single interval created once on mount, refs `selectedRef`/`cursorRef`/`pollInFlight`, deps all stable `useCallback`s): EVERY tick runs bridge POST → (open conversation) incremental thread deltas with `CURSOR_OVERLAP_MS = 2000` clock-skew window absorbed by the idempotent merge → catch-up deltas when `bridge.matched > 0` → lean card-list sync; NO secondary timers, no state-dependent gating; stops only on unmount. **(3) Live card merge fixed** — `refreshCardsSilently` now position-preserves existing rows AND prepends genuinely-new tickets (server sorts `updatedAt DESC`, so a new ticket belongs on top exactly like a manual reload), uses quietFetch transport with `fields=card` (`getTicketsQuiet` gained the param), and is churn-free: signature compare returns the exact previous state objects when nothing changed (no re-render, no flicker, no scroll movement); `applyIncremental`'s card update got the same guard. **(4) Bridge cost bounded** — `POST /api/tickets/inbound` keeps a bounded per-instance seen-set (`BRIDGE_SEEN_MAX` 4096 ring of PG message ids): an all-known pass short-circuits before ANY MongoDB work (two indexed PG SELECTs only), matched/duplicate outcomes remembered, unmatched retried cheaply; durable `sourceRef` dedupe remains the real boundary. On-demand native-receive kick (10s throttle) unchanged. Files: NEW `core/services/inboundBodyCleanup.ts`, `lib/tickets/inbound-core.ts`, `app/api/tickets/inbound/route.ts`, `core/services/ticketService.ts`, `app/admin/messages/AdminMessagesClient.tsx`. No mailbox/SMTP/IMAP-implementation/schema/auth/notification/storefront changes; chat bubble layout unchanged. Verified: `npx tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0; `next build` EXIT 0 (placeholder QStash keys); cleaner unit checks 12/12 (incl. the exact reported Gmail shape). NOT deployed; awaits user approval.

## Universal Email Unsubscribe System

Keep in sync with the master doc Progress Tracking ("Universal Email Unsubscribe
System"):

- **Single centralized store**: all unsubscribe preferences live in ONE PostgreSQL
  table `email_preferences` (`lib/backend-db/index.ts`), with columns `email`,
  `email_hash` (sha256 of lowercased email, unique), `token` (64-char hex, unique),
  `is_unsubscribed`, `unsubscribed_at`, `created_at`, `updated_at`. No MongoDB
  collection, no separate store for public vs internal — PostgreSQL is the single
  source of truth (both `app/api/*` public routes and `app/internal/backend/*`
  routes share it via `getDb()`).
- **Essential emails never unsubscribe**: `lib/email/unsubscribe.ts` exports
  `ESSENTIAL_EMAIL_TYPES` (otp_verification, password_reset, license_*,
  trial_*, device_replacement, subscription_renewal_reminder, payment_*,
  welcome_customer) — these ALWAYS send, no footer, no check.
  `INTERNAL_EMAIL_TYPES` (admin_notification, new_sales_enquiry,
  conversation_created) are staff-only — no footer, no check.
  `shouldIncludeUnsubscribe()` returns true only for customer-facing
  non-essential types: `support_reply`, `sales_reply`.
- **Send guard + footer** (`lib/email/brevo.ts` `sendEmail`): before sending a
  non-essential customer email, `await isUnsubscribed(recipientEmail)` is
  checked; if true, the email is SKIPPED and logged with
  `status:'skipped'` + `error:'Recipient has unsubscribed'` (no Brevo call).
  If not unsubscribed, a single-use `token` is UPSERTed via `getUnsubscribeLink`
  and an Unsubscribe footer (`UNSUBSCRIBE_FOOTER_HTML` / `UNSUBSCRIBE_FOOTER_TEXT`)
  is appended before `</body>` / after the body text, linking to
  `/unsubscribe_global?token=<token>`. No existing email body content is
  altered beyond this append.
- **Public unsubscribe endpoint** (`app/api/unsubscribe`, POST + GET): verifies
  the token, sets `is_unsubscribed = TRUE` + `unsubscribed_at`, returns
  `{ success, email }`. Returns 400 for invalid/missing token, 200 for
  already-unsubscribed. No auth required (`/api/*` bypasses the proxy).
- **Public page** (`app/unsubscribe_global/page.tsx`): `use client`, reads
  `token` from URL, shows a confirmation card with "Unsubscribe me" + "Cancel"
  buttons, calls the API on confirm, shows success/error states. Uses the
  existing `PublicPage` + `SimplePublicBody` layout. Added to
  `core/constants/routes.ts` (`PUBLIC_PATHS` + `PUBLIC_EXACT_ROUTES`) +
  `proxy.ts` `PUBLIC_PATHS` so the proxy never gates it.
- **Graceful degradation**: if `getDb()` fails (DATABASE_URL not set, DB down),
  `isUnsubscribed` returns `false` (fail-open - emails continue to send) and
  `getUnsubscribeLink` returns the base URL without a token (page shows error).

## R01 — Redis Rate Limiting + Cookie Consent/Analytics + Store UI (2026-08-17)

See master doc Progress Tracking rows **"R01 — Redis-backed Rate Limiting"**,
**"R01 — Cookie Consent Banner + Consent-gated Analytics"** and
**"R01 — Software Store UI fixes"**. Never regress:

- **Redis-backed rate limiting is the pattern**: all public/auth throttling uses
  Upstash Redis counters via the shared `lib/redis-client.ts` (env
  `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`/`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`, `Redis.fromEnv()`,
  **fail-open** on any Redis error — an unavailable Redis never locks out
  customers). Keys: `otp_send:<ip>` (5 / 10 min) + `otp_send_email:<email>`
  (5 / 10 min) + `otp_verify:<email>` (15 / 15 min) in `lib/otp/login-otp.ts`
  (covers website login + internal API login + resends);
  `pwd_reset:<ip>` (3 / hour, 429) in `app/api/auth/forgot-password/request/route.ts`;
  `portal_support:<ip>` (5 / 15 min, 429) in `app/api/portal/support-message/route.ts`
  (IP = `x-forwarded-for` first value → `x-real-ip` → unknown). Never revert to
  per-instance in-memory Maps for production throttling; keep catch-block
  fail-open semantics.
- **Cookie consent + analytics are consent-gated and UI-only**: the public
  website shows ONE bottom banner (`components/ui/CookieConsentBanner.tsx`,
  localStorage `cookie_consent_accepted`, Privacy Policy link, Accept/Reject)
  mounted via `app/ClientLayout.tsx` (dynamic, ssr:false, only on public
  non-auth non-store routes). `hooks/useAnalytics.ts` tracks `page_view` on
  route change ONLY after consent and never loads provider scripts without
  consent (external provider wires into `window.analytics`); the
  `AnalyticsTracker` component mounts it. No analytics on `/internal/*`,
  auth pages, or store/checkout pages.
- **Store navbar**: the `/software-store` sticky header's center search is
  `hidden sm:block` (mobile uses the hero search — same `query` state, synced);
  the sticky filter bar sits at `top-[61px]` (flush under the nav). Never
  reintroduce a permanently-visible navbar search that squeezes the icon
  cluster on phones, and never change the shared query state between the two
  search inputs.



## R04 — Chat Surface Redesign (Direct Secure Chat + Admin Messenger)

Keep in sync with the master doc Progress Tracking entry **"R04 — CHAT SURFACE
REDESIGN: shared 10-skin premium Messenger look for Direct Secure Chat + Admin
Messenger (AWS-01 R01, 2026-08-22)"**. Never regress:

- **UI/UX-only scope**: ONLY `app/chat/[id]/chatSkins.ts`,
  `components/shared/chatSurfaceCss.ts` (NEW), `app/chat/[id]/ClientChat.tsx`,
  `app/admin/messages/AdminMessagesClient.tsx`,
  `components/shared/ChatSkinPicker.tsx`. No backend/API/DB/auth/poll/send/
  email logic changed; no existing control removed.
- **One skin architecture**: `chatSkins.ts` = compact `SkinPalette` interface
  + `defineSkin()` builder + `hexA()` helper; all color roles REQUIRED
  (TS-enforced); every skin exposes the full `--sk-*` token set including the
  NEW tokens (`--sk-center-bg`, `--sk-client-text`, `--sk-outgoing-text`,
  `--sk-placeholder`, `--sk-icon`, `--sk-divider`, `--sk-hover-bg`,
  `--sk-selected-bg/-text`, `--sk-typing-dot`, `--sk-unread`,
  `--sk-secondary-*`, `--sk-status-open/closed`, `--sk-scroll-thumb`,
  `--sk-card-glow`, `--sk-tooltip-bg/text`). All 10 skin ids/names/order
  unchanged and the exported API is identical (`SKIN_STORAGE_KEY` =
  `"ws_chat_skin_id"`), so stored preferences keep working. Adding a skin =
  one palette object — never fork the token set.
- **ONE shared CSS module**: `CHAT_SURFACE_CSS` from
  `components/shared/chatSurfaceCss.ts` is injected via
  `<style dangerouslySetInnerHTML>` on BOTH surfaces; rules scoped under
  `.ws-chat-surface` resolving only `--sk-*` tokens: `.ws-chat-card/-header/
  -scroll`, `.ws-msg` (`wsMsgIn` entrance), `.ws-bubble-in/-out`, honest
  `.ws-send-pill` (Sending… dots, only while the send POST is in flight),
  themed scrollbar, placeholder/focus theming, `prefers-reduced-motion`
  guards. Never duplicate these rules inline in either page.
- **Center zone stays flat**: the CENTER 34% of `/chat/[id]` renders
  `background: var(--sk-center-bg)` with NO decorative layer (left stickers/
  social pops + right flying bubbles untouched). Status colors come from
  `var(--sk-status-open/closed)`, accents/timeline/chips in the Admin
  Messenger from `var(--sk-accent)`/`var(--sk-divider)`/`var(--sk-selected-bg)`
  — never hardcode hex in either chat UI.
- **Direct Chat button final UI (transparent chrome + slow premium border,
  2026-08-22)**: the `/chat/[id]` header buttons (`Client Login` / `Home` /
  theme trigger) have **NO visible button/card background** — `.ws-nav-btn`
  is `background: transparent` in the normal AND hover state (the old
  `--sk-btn-bg`/`--sk-btn-hover-bg` fills were removed), and the shared
  `ChatSkinPicker` trigger is flattened from THIS page only via the scoped
  `HEADER_BORDER_CSS` (`background: transparent !important` +
  `box-shadow: none !important`; the shared component file and the Admin
  Messenger are untouched). The animated directional hover border stays, and
  its draw is deliberately smooth/slow — `clip-path 0.8s
  cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` + `opacity 0.5s ease` (was `0.32s ease`) —
  never abrupt. Colors keep resolving from `--sk-*` tokens only
  (`--sk-focus-border` border, `--sk-btn-text` text, `--sk-accent` icon).
  Layout/animations/chat logic unchanged; `app/chat/[id]/ClientChat.tsx`
  is the only file.
- **Verification baseline**: tsc EXIT 0, build green; live headless-Chrome CDP
  12/12 on `/chat/[id]` (default classic surface, CHAT_SURFACE_CSS injected,
  picker opens 10 rows with `wsSkinPanelIn`, live midnight-gold switch
  recomputes center to `#0B0B0C` + persists localStorage, switch-back works).
  NOTE: live-tree `next start` may abort on the UNRELATED pre-existing route
  conflict `'id' !== 'projectId'` (`app/api/projects/[projectId]` restored
  alongside `[id]`) — verify against an isolated copy if present.
- **No floating chat widget on Direct Secure Chat (2026-08-22)**: the
  LeadConnector floating widget is EXCLUDED from `/chat/*` — `isStandaloneChatRoute`
  joined the existing checkout/product exclusions in `ClientLayout.tsx`'s
  `isPublicFacingPage` gate, so navigating to `/chat/[id]` runs the existing
  non-public branch (`ChatComponent` null + script removals) and direct loads
  never import it. The widget stays on ALL other public pages; the shared
  `components/ui/leadconnectorchat/` component and the Direct Chat itself are
  untouched.
- **MongoDB Complete Removal & Neon PostgreSQL Migration (2026-09-21)**:
  MongoDB has been completely removed from the entire platform and all collections,
  routes, documents, and credentials have been migrated to Neon PostgreSQL with ZERO
  data loss, zero session invalidation, and zero schema disruption.
  1. **Schema Isolation**: All 19 MongoDB collections (`users`, `clients`, `projects`,
     `tickets`, `resolution_templates`, `uploads`, `notifications`, `settings`,
     `services`, `project_offerings`, `notification_logs`, etc.) are housed in
     isolated PostgreSQL `portal_<collection>` tables (`_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY`, `data JSONB`,
     `created_at TIMESTAMPTZ`, `updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ`, GIN index on `data`),
     guaranteeing zero collision with existing relational tables (`users`, `notifications`,
     `settings`, `invoices`, etc.).
  2. **100% Data & Session Integrity**: All 98 documents across active collections
     were migrated without alteration. MongoDB 24-character hexadecimal IDs are preserved
     as strings in `_id` and inside the JSONB payload. Bcrypt password hashes, binary base64
     upload buffers, and active JWT session tokens (`sub: user._id`) remain fully valid.
  3. **Zero-Downtime Drop-In DB Engine**: `lib/server/db.ts` provides a high-performance,
     PostgreSQL-backed document engine implementing MongoDB-compatible interfaces
     (`ObjectId`, `parseObjectId`, `Collection<T>`, `Cursor<T>`, `Db`, `MongoClient`,
     `getPortalDb()`, with support for `$set`, `$unset`, `$inc`, `$push`, `$setOnInsert`,
     `$or`, `$and`, `$in`, `$regex`, and `bulkWrite`).
  4. **Clean Dependencies**: Removed `mongodb` package from `package.json` and removed
     `MONGODB_URI` from `.env`. The platform now operates on a single unified datastore:
     Neon PostgreSQL (`DATABASE_URL`).
