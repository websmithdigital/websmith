Yes. For your Websmith / Next.js / React project, I would narrow the list like this:

Website	What you get	Best for	My rating
React Bits	140+ animated components, backgrounds, text effects, particles, waves, orbits, visual effects; copy-paste source	Advanced animations & backgrounds	⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Aceternity UI	Large collection of animated React/Tailwind components, 3D effects, spotlights, cards, backgrounds	Premium/cinematic UI	⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Magic UI	Animated cards, marquees, beams, gradients, bento sections, marketing effects	Landing pages & marketing	⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
shadcn/ui	Buttons, dialogs, forms, dropdowns, tables and core UI primitives; source code is owned by you	Application foundation	⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Lerpa UI	1,300+ copy-paste React components, shadcn-compatible, Motion-based	Huge component selection	⭐⭐⭐⭐½
Uiverse	Community-created buttons, inputs, cards, loaders and CSS effects	Quick visual ideas	⭐⭐⭐⭐
HeroUI	Complete React component system with polished interactive components	Full application UI	⭐⭐⭐⭐½
Radix UI	Accessible unstyled primitives: dialogs, menus, popovers, tooltips, etc.	Accessible foundations	⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
DaisyUI	Tailwind-based buttons, cards, forms, navigation and themes	Fast Tailwind development	⭐⭐⭐⭐
HyperUI	Free Tailwind components and sections	Fast copy/paste layouts	⭐⭐⭐⭐
Animata	Small animated UI effects and components	Micro-interactions	⭐⭐⭐⭐
Cult UI	Creative React components and animated UI	Experimental/creative interfaces	⭐⭐⭐⭐
PrimeReact	Large enterprise component set, tables, forms, dialogs, data-heavy UI	Admin dashboards	⭐⭐⭐⭐½
🏆 For your Websmith project

I'd use a combination, not one library:

1. shadcn/ui → foundation
Forms, dialogs, dropdowns, navigation, settings, admin-style UI.

2. React Bits → animation layer
This is especially strong for the type of things you're currently building: floating elements, animated backgrounds, text effects, particles, orbit effects, etc. Its current library advertises 140+ components and multiple animation/background categories.

3. Aceternity UI → premium visual effects
Best when you want a section to have a strong "wow" effect—3D cards, spotlights, animated backgrounds, beams, etc. Its 2026 guide specifically positions it strongly for animated landing pages.

4. Magic UI → polished marketing sections
Very useful for hero sections, marquees, bento layouts, glowing elements and marketing animations.

5. Lerpa UI → when you need something very specific
Its current registry has 1,318 components, with copy-paste/source ownership and shadcn compatibility.

My overall choice

🥇 React Bits — best for the kind of highly animated Websmith UI you're building.

🥈 Aceternity UI — best for premium cinematic effects.

🥉 shadcn/ui — best core foundation.

So for Websmith I would build:

shadcn/ui + React Bits + selected Aceternity UI + selected Magic UI

rather than installing 15–20 libraries. This keeps the project more controllable and avoids unnecessary dependencies.
